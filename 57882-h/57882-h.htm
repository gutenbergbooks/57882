<small>A FLORIDA METROPOLIS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>All afternoon the train had been following
the picturesque shore of the Indian River, in
Florida. The snow and ice of the north had
long since disappeared. Summer heat increased
as the train sped southward. Most of the seats
in the car were filled with tourists on their
way to Palm Beach. Two persons, both from
their looks and actions, were not destined to
that aristocratic winter resort.</p>

<p>In one of the sections were a woman and a
boy. The latter, about sixteen years old, was
begrimed with dust and smoke, but there was a
snap in his eyes. In the fast gathering dusk,
he sat, his nose mashed against the window and
his eyes shaded by his hands, as if anxious to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
catch every detail of the strange land through
which the train was flying.</p>

<p>The woman glanced out of the window now
and then in a nervous manner, and, at last,
when it was almost wholly dark and the porter
had begun to turn on the electric lights, she
touched the boy on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Look at your watch again, Andrew. We
must be almost there.”</p>

<p>As the boy drew out a watch (his father’s,
lent to him as a safeguard on the long trip),
his lips puckered.</p>

<p>“Twenty minutes!” he exclaimed, almost in
alarm. “We’re due at Valkaria at 8:15. It’s
five minutes of eight now.”</p>

<p>“O, dear, I hope they won’t forget to stop,”
said the woman, with increasing nervousness.
“Hadn’t you better speak to the conductor
again? I don’t know what we’d do if we were
carried past our station.”</p>

<p>“I know,” answered the boy, with a laugh.
“If they forgot us, they’d have to bring us back
for nothing. But the conductor won’t forget.
I’ve pestered him so often about it that I guess
he’ll be glad to get rid of us.”</p>

<p>“I never thought about it being dark when
we got there,” the woman went on, as the lights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
in the car turned the outside world into blackness.
“I suppose we’d better not try to open
up your uncle’s house to-night.” She looked
out into the deep shadows of the palmettos.
“We’ll go to a hotel or boarding house
to-night.”</p>

<p>“What’s the use?” argued the boy. “That
is, unless you are too tired. It’ll be a useless
expense. I’d like to find the house to-night, if
we can. Someone can show us. Every one in
the town’ll know where Uncle Abner lived.”</p>

<p>“We must go to Captain Anderson first,” replied
the woman at once. “He is the one who
wrote to us of your uncle’s death, and sent the
body to us for burial. He has the key to the
house, and he was your uncle’s friend.”</p>

<p>“Maybe their homes were near together,”
suggested the boy hopefully. “I guess it isn’t
a very big town, and it won’t be very late. We
can go to a restaurant and get our supper and
then find Captain Anderson. He can take us
right to the house to-night. It’ll be kind o’ like
campin’ out—”</p>

<p>“Camping out?” interrupted the woman. “I
hope not, although,” and she smiled faintly,
“that would just suit you.”</p>

<p>The boy only laughed and again tried to make
out the landscape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” he said at last, “even if it’s on the
main street of Valkaria, it won’t be far to the
river, and that’ll be something.”</p>

<p>“What do you think it will be like?” asked
the woman as she gathered her bag and wraps
together.</p>

<p>“I don’t care much,” replied the boy,
dragging his suitcase from beneath the seat,
“just so it isn’t too fancy—I don’t want to
be mowing lawns all the time, ’specially in
January.”</p>

<p>Just then there was the hoarse sound of the
locomotive whistle, and, almost with it, the
grinding of the quick set brakes. As the woman
and the boy sprang to their feet, the train conductor
hurried into the car and the porter
sprang forward to help with the baggage of the
anxious travelers. As the other passengers
aroused themselves in surprise at the unexpected
stop, the woman and the boy were hurried
to the platform and, the long train scarcely
coming to a stop, assisted precipitately from the
car.</p>

<p>Instead of landing upon a depot platform,
the two suddenly disembarked passengers found
themselves on a sandy incline, slipping slowly
downward into a dry ditch. They were conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that their bag, suitcase and wraps
had lodged somewhere near their feet. Scrambling
to upright positions, they both turned
only to see two fading green lights marking the
fast disappearing Lake Worth express.</p>

<p>“Andrew!” exclaimed the woman, clasping
the boy’s arm.</p>

<p>“Looks like they’ve dumped us into nothin’,
mother.”</p>

<p>“It’s gone!” the woman almost shouted.</p>

<p>“Gone?” repeated the boy. “You bet she’s
gone, and gettin’ goner about a mile a minute.”</p>

<p>“What’ll we do?”</p>

<p>The boy laid his hands on his mother’s arms.</p>

<p>“Looks like a mistake. But don’t get scared.
Let’s look about. If this is Valkaria, I reckon
it must be the outskirts of the town.”</p>

<p>“The trunks,” cried the boy’s mother. “And
they’ve taken our trunks. What are we to do?
Something awful is sure to happen to us.”</p>

<p>“It hasn’t happened yet, mother. And I can
begin to see something. What’s this?”</p>

<p>On the far side of the ditch, a dark mass outlined
itself in the night. While his mother protested,
the boy clambered up the bank. Then a
peal of boyish laughter sounded in the still
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all right, mother. We’re right in town.
This is the union depot. It’s an old box car.
And here’s the sign on it—‘Valkaria.’”</p>

<p>There was a half hysterical sob, and the boy
rushed back to his frightened parent.</p>

<p>“Don’t be scared, mother. It’s all right.
This is the place. There’s bound to be someone
near. Brace up.”</p>

<p>Just then the hoarse croak of a frog sounded,
and the woman broke into tears. The boy,
attempting to pacify her, began another survey
of his surroundings.</p>

<p>“Look, mother. It’ll be moonlight in a little
while. See!”</p>

<p>As he pointed to the east, they could make
out the glowing rim of the full moon just silvering
the waxen tops of the encircling palmettos.
Composing herself somewhat, the frightened
woman allowed the boy to help her through
the loose sand to the makeshift depot.</p>

<p>Along the front of it ran a rude, tramp-hacked
bench. On this, the two seated themselves.
The depot-car was doorless. As the
boy observed this, he laughed again.</p>

<p>“Why, this isn’t bad, mother. We can sleep
in here—”</p>

<p>“In there?” protested his mother. “There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
are insects there, I know. I’m not going to
move from this bench till daylight. Then we’ll
take the first train back to the north.”</p>

<p>“It may be our mistake, mother. Maybe Valkaria
isn’t a town at all. I reckon it isn’t,
judgin’ by the depot.”</p>

<p>“Why should they call an old car ‘Valkaria?’”
exclaimed the woman. “Cars don’t
have names. They have numbers.”</p>

<p>“I give it up,” answered the boy, with some
cheerfulness. “But I don’t see that it’s so bad.
The weather is fine. I’ll bet it’s dandy around
here in the daytime. That moon’s makin’
things kind o’ great, now.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” exclaimed the woman, suddenly
catching her son by the arm and pointing
in the direction in which the train disappeared.
“There! Across the railroad!”</p>

<p>The boy had seen it too. A broad, ribbon-like
band of chalky-white extended from the black
shadow of the palmettos on the left, crossed the
track, and lost itself in the blackness beyond.
As the boy looked he caught sight of similar
thin strips along the track.</p>

<p>“It’s sand, mother. Looks like a ghost, but
it’s white Florida sand. And I’ll bet it’s a
road. Let’s try it. If it’s a road, it goes
somewhere.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Anything was better than the black, noisome
box car. The boy made his way into the now
half illuminated ditch and collected the scattered
baggage. Laden with it, the marooned
travelers set forward. As the boy surmised,
the white strip was a road. When they reached
it, they discovered, to their relief, safely lying
in the gully beyond the crossing, their two
trunks.</p>

<p>“Better get ’em out o’ the ditch, in case o’
rain,” said the boy, and, despite his years, the
well-muscled lad tackled the job. It was not an
easy one, but, by rolling and sliding, the heavy
parcels were soon landed on the edge of the
soft roadway. The moon was now shining so
brightly that the lad could make out the time.
It was 8:35 P.M.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the lad, mopping his face, “we
can go toward the river or away from it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the town is on the river,” suggested
his mother, more composed. “We’ll
try—there’s a light,” she added excitedly.</p>

<p>Far down the white strip of road was certainly
a light. From its low, regular swing, the
boy at once concluded that it was a lantern.
He so informed his mother, who immediately
became newly panic-stricken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“It may be robbers,” she gasped, clutching
her son’s arm again.</p>

<p>“Robbers don’t carry lanterns, mother.
Let’s hope it’s the hotel runner or transfer
man.”</p>

<p>“Or tramps,” added the woman in a frightened
whisper.</p>

<p>“Look here, mother,” answered the boy
soberly. “You know the only way for us to
get out of this mess is to find someone to tell us
where we are and what we’ve got to do. There
is certainly someone coming toward us. Do
you want to meet whomever it is, or run away
and hide in the bushes?”</p>

<p>“I suppose we ought to wait,” answered his
mother meekly.</p>

<p>“Wait nothin’,” exclaimed the boy. “We’ll
march right up to the relief party.”</p>

<p>Leaving their baggage in the road, the boy
took his mother by the hand and, despite her
alarm, marched her forward along the road.
The suspense was soon over. In a few moments,
a figure emerged from the shadows.
While it was yet a hundred yards away, the
anxious boy, partly to keep up his courage,
sang out a bold “Hello!”</p>

<p>“You folks get off that train?” was the response
in a man’s voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“We did,” answered the boy. “Where’s
Valkaria?”</p>

<p>“Valkaria?” repeated the approaching
stranger good-naturedly. “Why, you’re right
on the main street now.”</p>

<p>The man, who by this time had reached them,
was unquestionably neither robber nor tramp.
He was past middle age, well but roughly
dressed, and wore a yachting cap on top of a
good growth of silvery white hair, which lay
above a face bronzed by the sun and wind.</p>

<p>“We are from the north,” hastily explained
the woman, “and we are looking for the place
where my brother-in-law, Mr. Abner Leighton,
lived—”</p>

<p>“Then you must be—”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Howard Leighton, of St. Paul. And
this is my son, Andrew. We have come—”</p>

<p>“I understand,” interrupted the man quickly.
“I wrote to your husband. My name is Anderson—Captain
Anderson. Why didn’t you
let me know? We’d have met you. I heard
the train stop, and I wondered what it meant.
So I came up to see. I’m glad to meet you.”</p>

<p>“And you live here?” began Mrs. Leighton,
as Captain Anderson shook hands with her and
Andy. “You can’t imagine how relieved I am.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
But are there any buildings—a hotel or boarding
house?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Andy. “We’ve got all
this stuff scattered along Main Street, and
haven’t had any supper, and as for sleepin’—”</p>

<p>Captain Anderson laughed and picked up his
lantern.</p>

<p>“As for your baggage, we’ll take care of
that in short order. Your uncle and I were
friends for many years. His house is over on
the other side of the railroad. You can’t go
there to-night. My place is down here on the
river—”</p>

<p>“But, Captain—” began Mrs. Leighton.</p>

<p>“Young man,” interrupted the captain,
ignoring Mrs. Leighton’s protest, “take this
lantern and start right down the road with your
mother. I’ll be after you as soon as I find those
grips. You’ll eat and sleep to-night in the
Anderson house. There isn’t any Valkaria
but a signboard.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>THE STRANGE WORK OF A WILDERNESS EXILE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Captain Joe Anderson’s real home was in
the north on one of the great lakes. As a
young man he had devoted much of his time to
yachting. Therefore, when he and Mrs. Anderson
sought a winter home in the south, he
built his bungalow on the wide, baylike Indian
River.</p>

<p>To this salubrious spot Captain Joe and his
wife hastened each fall. With no servants,
Mrs. Anderson saw to the few household needs.
Living on the shore of the biggest and most
beautiful body of boating water in America,
Captain Joe gave every daylight hour to sailing
and making boats.</p>

<p>Just to the left of his trim little cottage was
a low, wide building. Therein, when summer
came, Captain Anderson stored his boats.
These ran from his well-known sailing yacht
“Valkaria,” down through smaller craft for
fishing and cruising to three or four skiffs or
rowboats. He had no power-boats and, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Andy Leighton soon learned, had no patience
with those who owned or operated them.</p>

<p>At this time of the year, with his boats safely
moored at the long pier, which extended 150
yards out into the shallow river, the boathouse
was a boat shop. Here, when he was not on
the water sailing with Mrs. Anderson, Captain
Joe was busy, slowly working into shape some
new water craft. Some days, when it rained
or a norther brought a chill to the balmy spot,
he would kindle a fire in the big stove in the
boathouse, and, his tools lying idle, sit and
read.</p>

<p>Before Mrs. Leighton and Andy had even
come in sight of the light in the Anderson home
the captain had rejoined them.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how we are going to repay
you for your kindness, Captain Anderson,”
Andy’s mother began.</p>

<p>“I know one way,” answered their rescuer
good-humoredly. “Your brother-in-law’s home
isn’t much of a place, but if you and your son
can see your way to livin’ there awhile each
winter, that’ll be all the reward I want. It
gets pretty lonesome down here sometimes for
Mrs. Anderson.”</p>

<p>Then the two older persons began to exchange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
talk about their northern homes and
possible mutual friends. At the first opportunity,
Andy broke in:</p>

<p>“Captain Anderson, what did my uncle do
down here? I suppose he raised oranges.”</p>

<p>“Your uncle was a peculiar man,” answered
the captain. “I liked him. But I never could
understand why a good lawyer should bury
himself in the wilderness.”</p>

<p>“Father says he used to be a fine lawyer,”
commented the boy, “but his health failed.”</p>

<p>“And like a lot more such people,” added
Captain Anderson, “he got to livin’ alone and
bein’ so much alone, he got sort o’ peculiar.”</p>

<p>“One could tell that from his letters, when
we got any,” interrupted Mrs. Leighton. “He
used to write about some invention on which
he was working.”</p>

<p>“An engine,” broke in Andy. “Father told
me my uncle thought he had an engine that was
to do wonderful things. Did it work?”</p>

<p>“Oh, his engine worked all right,” answered
Captain Joe soberly. “There wasn’t any
trouble about that. That wasn’t his real weakness.
He made engines that’d work just as
long as he ran ’em like other people, with steam
or gasoline. But steam and gasoline didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
suit him. He was lookin’ for some other kind
o’ power; something cheap and light—calcium
something I think it was.”</p>

<p>“Gas from calcium carbide?” suggested
Andy impulsively.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it—calcium carbide,” went on
Captain Joe, “though I never took any stock
in it and never paid much attention to it. He
said when he got his generator finished, he’d
be able to carry his power in a little tube.”</p>

<p>“And did he?” persisted Andy, pushing forward.
“Did he finish his generator?”</p>

<p>Instead of replying at once, Captain Anderson
dropped back by Mrs. Leighton’s side.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said soberly, “the doctor said
your brother-in-law died o’ heart disease.
But there was enough other things in that shop
o’ his to kill him,—gases and fumes and odors,—and
if I had a guess about what ended his
lonesome life, I’d say it was as much that idea
of his as a weak heart. If he ever got at the
bottom o’ what he was lookin’ for,” added
Captain Anderson, turning to the eager Andy,
“I reckon no one’ll ever know unless he wrote
it down. And there’s nothin’ o’ that sort so
far as I know.”</p>

<p>While Mrs. Leighton made further inquiries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
concerning her late relative Andy’s brain was
beginning to burn with a sudden and new curiosity.
Andy’s father was a factory foreman,
and the family lived in a modest home in a city
suburb, but the boy had already finished the
second year of high school. Andy had all the
dreams, desires, and determinations of the
average boy. But he had something more—a
decided bent for mechanics.</p>

<p>Only the summer before, Andy and a classmate
had made a single-cylinder gas engine.
It didn’t happen to work when completed, but
that didn’t matter. The making of it had given
Andy a good knowledge of engines. Like many
an older person, he was already theorizing on
a new motive power. Anyway, he knew what
Captain Joe meant when he spoke of “calcium
something.”</p>

<p>“Captain Anderson,” said Andy, breaking
in on the talk of his elders, “is it too late to see
my uncle’s shop to-night?”</p>

<p>“It’ll be too late when we’ve had some
supper. But in the morning I’ll turn over the
key. Everything is there just as Mr. Leighton
left it—except the engine he made two years
ago, and that’s in my boathouse.”</p>

<p>“Does that one work?” persisted Andy,
eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“It does, with gasoline,” returned the man.
“That’s the one your uncle made for the aero-catamaran.
I’ll turn that over to you—I
haven’t any use for power-boats.”</p>

<p>“Aero-catamaran?” exclaimed Andy.
“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“That?” repeated the captain. “Why,—but
here’s the house.”</p>

<p>“Tell me just one thing,” pleaded the excited
boy. “Is the aero-catamaran a boat?”</p>

<p>“A kind of a boat—or was,” laughed the
captain.</p>

<p>“And it belonged to my uncle?”</p>

<p>“I made the boat, but your uncle made the
engine, and I gave him the boat—no power-boats
for me.”</p>

<p>“Can I have it?” blurted out Andy.</p>

<p>“Andrew!” broke in Mrs. Leighton. “What
do you mean? I’m ashamed of you.”</p>

<p>“I meant,” began Andy, abashed, “that I’d
like to see it and—and run it.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” laughed the captain. “I understand.
Well, anyway, it’s no use to me. I
know nothing about engines.”</p>

<p>Just then the party reached the cottage. Mrs.
Anderson waited for no introductions. In a
few minutes Mrs. Leighton and Andy were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
seated in a summery living room. While Mrs.
Leighton protested over the unexpected hospitality
and Mrs. Anderson removed her guest’s
wraps, Captain Anderson could be heard starting
anew the fire in the kitchen cook stove.</p>

<p>“We haven’t any guest chamber,” explained
Mrs. Anderson, with a laugh; “but you,” taking
Mrs. Leighton by the arm, “will share my
bedroom with me. Captain Anderson will sleep
in the boathouse, and the boy can sleep on the
couch in this room.”</p>

<p>Their hostess had already led Mrs. Leighton
into the adjoining room. So Andy improved
the opportunity to look about. The room had a
sort of seaside air. Within an unusual fireplace
of stone, stood the model of a schooner-rigged
yacht. On the mantel was a large silver
cup, apparently a prize or a trophy, while at
the right and the left of it, were large pink-hearted
conch shells. On the wall above was a
decoration of pink, yellow, and purple West
Indian sea fans.</p>

<p>While the highly interested boy was noting
these things, Captain Anderson reappeared.</p>

<p>“I reckon mother can see to something in the
way of eatin’, Andy,” he said with a laugh,
“and we’ll just about have time to get the
trunks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>As the boy responded with a laugh of his
own he pointed to the sea fans on the wall.</p>

<p>“They don’t grow here, do they?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Those?” said the boy’s host. “Oh, no;
they came from the sea gardens near Nassau.
Mrs. Anderson and I usually sail over there
each spring—for a change.”</p>

<p>“From here?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“Why not?” responded the captain, with a
smile. “But I suppose you don’t know that the
Indian River is only an arm of the sea. It runs
all along the coast like a big inland lake, and
there are several places where you can get out
to sea.”</p>

<p>“And Nassau,” repeated the open-mouthed
Andy—“where’s that?”</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll have to get down the map for
you,” answered the amused captain. “Nassau
is the only town in all the three thousand or
more Bahama Islands. And it’s about two
hundred and fifty miles from here. But you
can strike the Bahamas long before that. In
one place they’re not over eighty-five miles
from America.”</p>

<p>As Andy’s eyes contracted, a mind reader
would have detected these thoughts already
linking themselves in the boy’s brain: “working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
engine, boat, Indian River, ocean, Bahama
Islands.”</p>

<p>“I guess I know what you’re thinkin’ about,”
ventured Captain Anderson, with a mischievous
laugh. “And if I’m not mistaken, in the next
few days there’s goin’ to be a pretty busy boy
around these parts.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Andy, with a similar smile,
“wherever I am, I’m not in the habit of takin’
root. And I won’t need a gong to get me up in
the morning.”</p>

<p>By the time the man and the boy had secured
the broad-wheeled trundle cart that Captain
Anderson used in transporting freight, and
had gone for the trunks, Mrs. Leighton had
refreshed herself by removing the stains of
travel, and Mrs. Anderson was well forward
in the preparation of a supper for the
strangers.</p>

<p>“It’s a long way to haul the trunks for just
over night,” said Mrs. Leighton, as Captain
Anderson and Andy carried them onto the
gallery.</p>

<p>“It’s the easiest way,” explained Captain
Anderson. “When you want to send them to
Mr. Leighton’s house, we’ll take ’em by water.
Goat Creek empties into the river just above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
here, and it winds back right past your brother-in-law’s
place. I’ll have to lend Andy one of
my rowboats.”</p>

<p>“Supper’s all ready,” announced Mrs. Anderson.
“We haven’t any real milk or cream,
and no real butter, but we get used to
substitutes.”</p>

<p>With this apology she seated her guests to a
repast of fried lake trout, fried yams, homemade
bread, orange marmalade, guava jelly,
tea, and by way of dessert, an enormous pineapple
ripened on the plant. By the time the
tired and hungry travelers had shown their full
appreciation of Mrs. Anderson’s culinary skill
it was well after ten o’clock. Mrs. Leighton
and Mrs. Anderson having arranged Andy’s
bed on the couch, they withdrew.</p>

<p>As Captain Anderson lit a lantern for use
in the boathouse, Andy, a little embarrassed,
whispered:</p>

<p>“Captain Anderson, can’t I see those maps
you were talking about—those that show where
the Bahama Islands are?”</p>

<p>The captain, with a grunt of amusement, went
to a rack and took down a chart.</p>

<p>“On one condition: you mustn’t stay up
more than fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>With a nod of acquiescence, Andy—who had
never seen the ocean, and who had not the
slightest knowledge of boats—caught the map
eagerly and hastened to the table on which was
a big oil lamp. As Captain Anderson left the
room he glanced back and saw the excited boy
intently poring over an old chart of the Bahama
and West India Islands.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<small>A BOAT WITHOUT SAILS, SCREW, OR OARS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It did not require a gong to arouse Andy in
the morning, but it did call for a gentle shaking
from his mother’s hand.</p>

<p>“Gee!” he exclaimed as he tumbled out of
bed, “I’m losin’ time. But I reckon I’d better
wait till breakfast is over.”</p>

<p>“Just what is all this hurry about?” asked
Mrs. Leighton. “You must remember, my son,
this is not a hotel.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” explained the boy, “but there
is so much to do to-day.”</p>

<p>“Well, please don’t get excited,” said his
mother with some severity, “we’ll proceed
with our own affairs when it suits our host and
hostess. And remember, Andy, you are not
to accept a boat from Captain Anderson as a
gift.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” answered the boy, with an
attempt to control his enthusiasm. “But, say,
mother, look at this.”</p>

<p>He caught up the map he had so eagerly examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the night before. His hair tousled, and
still in his bare feet, Andy spread it before his
perplexed mother. “Here, look,” he went on,
“all these things are islands, the Bahama Islands,
the West India Islands—that’s where
everything comes from you read about—sponges
and tropical fruits, bananas and
things, and,” he looked up, his eyes blazing,
“we could go there if we had a boat—they’re
right over here—”</p>

<p>“Andrew,” said his mother slowly, as she
motioned him toward his undonned clothes,
“you are here because your father couldn’t
come and because I couldn’t come alone. When
we have looked into your dead uncle’s affairs
and arranged them as well as we can, we are
going back home. We are not going to the
Bahamas.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” answered Andy meekly.</p>

<p>“From the minute we landed here, you’ve
been excited. You seem to think this is the
beginning of some remarkable adventure. It
isn’t. It is a business trip.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>“Now, you quiet yourself, get on your
clothes, and when we’ve had our breakfast and
Captain Anderson is ready, we’ll go about our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
business like two sane persons. Don’t let me
hear anything more about engines, boats, or the
West Indies.”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>A little later, Andy, having completed his
morning toilet, slowly wandered from the house
toward the pier where Captain Anderson was
making an early examination of his boats.</p>

<p>“Hello there!” sang out the captain. “I
thought you’d be out by sun up.”</p>

<p>“I kind o’ overslept,” answered Andy sadly.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter? Didn’t you rest
well?”</p>

<p>“Too well,” was the boy’s slow rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t worry about it. We’ve got lots
of time to talk over things. Did you lay out a
course to the Bahamas before you turned in?”</p>

<p>Andy sighed and looked sorrowfully out
over the river.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doin’ in the Bahamas line,” he
said at last.</p>

<p>“You seem to be in the dumps,” Captain
Anderson remarked.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’d be, too, if you had the trimmin’
I just got.”</p>

<p>“Trimmin’?”</p>

<p>“My mother thinks I’ve been botherin’ you
too much. Have I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Botherin’ me? How?”</p>

<p>“Oh, buttin’ in about engines, and beggin’
you to let me have that aero-catamaran, and
talkin’ boats, and borrowin’ your map, and pesterin’
you about the Bahamas.”</p>

<p>“She don’t really believe that, does she?
Why, Andy, I put all those things in your
head.”</p>

<p>“She says we’re down here on business.
When we attend to that, we’re goin’ back home.
I’m sorry we had to bother you at all. I guess
you can keep the aero-catamaran.”</p>

<p>The good-natured captain was shaking with
laughter.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” he said, at last, with a chuckle,
“she won’t care if you just <em>look</em> at the engine,
and you’d better look at the rowboat I’m
goin’ to give you—”</p>

<p>“Got orders on that, too. You’ve done too
much for us already. I can’t take it.”</p>

<p>“Can’t, eh?” said the captain quizzically.
“Why not buy it?”</p>

<p>The boy had his eyes fixed longingly on a
staunch, flat-bottomed skiff, painted red, and
carrying the name <i>Red Bird</i> in white.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that we can afford it,” he said
in a hesitating voice.</p>

<p>“Well, of course, if I sell it, I must have my
price,” went on the amused captain. “There’s
a little leg-o’-mutton sail that goes with her.”</p>

<p>“What’s a boat like that worth?” Andy
asked at last.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have to figure,” answered his
elder, puckering his mouth. “The stuff in her
was secondhand, and I reckon it cost me $1.50.
Then there was the labor, say two days. We’ll
call it a dollar and a half a day—that’s $4.50
altogether. And about a quarter for paint—”</p>

<p>“And the mast and sail?” suggested Andy.</p>

<p>“Nothin’,” answered Captain Anderson.
“The stick floated in, and the sail ain’t anything
but a scrap.”</p>

<p>“Could you afford to sell her for $4.75?”</p>

<p>“I could,” answered the captain, “but it
wouldn’t be fair. A boat like that won’t last
over five years, and this one is over two years
old. She’s two-fifths gone. Take her for
three-fifths of $4.75.”</p>

<p>When the boy had figured that it was $2.85,
his frown suddenly changed to a smile.</p>

<p>“Captain,” he exclaimed, “I almost bit.
You’re kiddin’ me. I’d rather take it as a gift
than offer you $2.85 for a boat like that. No,”
and his troubled look returned. “Nothin’ doin’
in the boat line, either.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Anderson made no answer to the
boy’s statement other than to smile again and
to throw open the door of the boathouse.
Within, and occupying a space about twenty by
thirty feet, was a combined reading and man’s
living room, carpenter and machine shop, and
general repository of all sorts of delightful
odds and ends. To Andy the big room was
redolent with a variety of fascinating odors—from
fresh oak and pine shavings, oakum, pitch,
and tar—new reminders of boats and the sea.</p>

<p>In one corner stood a desk, a bookcase
jammed with volumes of many sizes, a cot, and
a stove.</p>

<p>“My rainy day corner,” suggested the boy’s
guide.</p>

<p>On the opposite side stood two workbenches
and a foot-power lathe, while, on the benches
and above them on the wall, were tools of all
kinds.</p>

<p>From the rafters, suspended on big wooden
hooks, hung spars, oars, and strips of many
kinds of wood. In the midst of these, resting
on two special racks, were what appeared to
be two racing shells, each about twenty feet
long.</p>

<p>“They’re part of it,” volunteered Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Anderson, as he saw Andy gazing in admiration
at the fragile boats. “They’re the part of
the aero-catamaran we made.”</p>

<p>“And the engine?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>“Over here,” replied the captain. “A little
rusty, but protected as well as I know how.
She hasn’t turned a wheel in over two years.”</p>

<p>As he withdrew a tarpaulin cover the boy
could not restrain himself. He burst out:</p>

<p>“Did my uncle make that?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t suspect I did it, did you?”
laughed Captain Anderson.</p>

<p>The boy was already on his knees. He didn’t
understand boats, but gas engines he did understand.
For several minutes the excited boy
hung over the motor; his fingers moved over its
perfect parts. Then he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“Do you know what that is, Captain Anderson?”
he exclaimed with all his former fervor.</p>

<p>“Your uncle called it a gas engine. But it
always struck me as pretty light weight for an
engine.”</p>

<p>“Did it run all right?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Run?” repeated the captain. “She ran like
a house afire.”</p>

<p>“If that motor,” said Andy slowly, “is as
good as it looks, it is a better piece of machinery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
than anything of the kind ever made in
America. Why, we send to France for engines
like that, and pay $2,000 for ’em. Are you sure
my uncle made it?”</p>

<p>“You’ll see his shop this morning,” was the
captain’s only answer.</p>

<p>“He was two years ahead of the rest of the
world,” said Andy decisively. “Why, it’s
almost as light as a Fiat. Eight cylinders and
water cooled,” he went on, as if talking to himself.
“Did he ever say what horse power it
developed?”</p>

<p>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>“Listen to those cylinders!” exclaimed the
boy, as he tapped them with a pencil. “Thin as
a drumhead. Auto-lubricating alloy for bearings,
too,” he added with increasing excitement.
“And hollow steel tubing instead of solid rods—every
atom pared away that can be spared.
Captain Anderson,” concluded the young expert,
springing to his feet again, “I’ll tell you
what this engine is—it’s the most perfect aeroplane
motor ever made!”</p>

<p>“Aeroplane?” repeated Captain Anderson.
“Flyin’ machine engine? ’Twasn’t made for
that. It was made to run a boat.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what it was made for; it’s an
aeroplane motor and a beauty—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you gentlemen be good enough to come
to breakfast?”</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Anderson, standing in the boathouse
door.</p>

<p>Too excited to respond immediately, Andy
continued:</p>

<p>“Why did he make such a light engine, if it
was for use on a boat?”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s the idea,” explained the captain,
nodding to his wife. “Your uncle lived
here nearly ten years. Finally he had to take
to boating. But he hadn’t any more use for
a sailboat than I have for a power-boat. So he
rigged up a gasoline engine and a screw on an
old hull, and began runnin’ aground on every
bar in the river. That’s when I had the laugh
on him, because I knew the channels. At last
he got mad. And one day, he figured out the
aero-catamaran. Here’s a plan of it,” added
the captain, pointing to a scale drawing on the
wall.</p>

<p>“It has air propellers!” was Andy’s immediate
exclamation.</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the captain. “And <em>they</em> were
all right; they made her hump, too.”</p>

<p>The design showed the two twenty-foot narrow
boats (or racing shells) braced together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
after the manner of East India catamarans.
On the crosspieces, which afforded a deck space
seven feet wide, a heavier frame was shown.
On this, rising something less than a foot above
the boat gunwales, rested the engine, from
which a shaft extended sternward.</p>

<p>Beginning at the engine, and also extending
aft, was another open frame six feet long and
seven by seven feet in width and height.
Shafted on each top rear corner of this frame
was a six-foot propeller connected with the engine
shaft by chain drives. In front of the engine
the boat braces were decked and here, similar
to an automobile steering wheel, was a
wheel from which wires extended to the rudder
at the stern of each shell.</p>

<p>“Why’d you take her apart?” asked Andy
at last, his voice full of unmeant rebuke.</p>

<p>“We didn’t,” explained Captain Anderson.
“We made her just as you see her in the picture,
and she did what her designer planned,—paid
no attention to bars and reefs. She even
gave the <i>Valkaria</i> a black eye, making sixteen
miles on smooth water. But—”</p>

<p>“But what?” interrupted Andy.</p>

<p>“Everything was all right but the braces, the
catamaran part. The first gale that hit her
twisted her to pieces.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>THE SEQUEL OF THE AERO-CATAMARAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Andy’s busy brain was full of the aero-catamaran
and the wonderful engine, but, mindful
of his mother’s admonition, he restrained
his enthusiasm. It was agreed that all should
start for the late home of the boy’s eccentric
uncle as soon as Mrs. Anderson’s morning work
was done.</p>

<p>“We’ll use both the little boats,” explained
the generous captain. “I’ll take the ladies in
one, and we’ll tow the other one with Andy
and the baggage for cargo.”</p>

<p>The moment breakfast was over Andy managed
to get the captain into the boathouse again
that he might see the propellers—for he was
still thinking. These, with the engine shaft,
chain drives, steering wheel, and rudder wires
had also been preserved.</p>

<p>“Are you thinkin’ o’ tryin’ to rig her up
again?” asked the captain, as Andy began a
close examination of the parts.</p>

<p>The boy looked up with a doubtful smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“You could,” added the captain, “but she’d
have to be better braced. The trouble was when
you turned her in a sea. The waves would
raise one boat and drop the other. The steel
beams wouldn’t hold.”</p>

<p>Andy nodded, and carried one of the six-foot
propellers nearer the door. It was of some
light, close-grained wood, finished as smoothly
as glass. The blades, pear-shaped with a decided
pitch, tapered gracefully to the metal
shaft-block in the center.</p>

<p>“Where’d he get these?” asked Andy admiringly,
as he brushed the dust from the
golden-varnished blades.</p>

<p>“I’m a little proud o’ them,” confessed the
captain. “I made ’em. But they weren’t my
idea. I never saw anything like ’em until your
uncle laid ’em out on paper, curves and all.”</p>

<p>“What’ll you take for them?” asked the boy
longingly.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you all that truck is yours or
your mother’s, or your father’s?”</p>

<p>“Did uncle pay you for your work?”</p>

<p>“Well, to tell the truth, it wasn’t a question
of pay between us,” explained the captain. “It
was his idea and his boat. I made him a
<em>present</em> of all I did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“You think so, now,” said the boy with a
smile. “But I reckon what’s here is as much
yours as it was his—or more. Much obliged
for the offer, but I think my mother would
make a fuss if I took anything.”</p>

<p>The captain only shrugged his broad shoulders.
In an instant the boy had replaced the
propeller and was at his new friend’s side.</p>

<p>“Captain,” he said in almost a whisper,
“don’t you say a thing to her. But I have an
idea—and it’s a dandy. It’s a big idea, and
it’s goin’ to take both you and me to work it
out—”</p>

<p>“Bully for you!” exclaimed the captain.
“But it ain’t another motor boat, is it?”</p>

<p>For answer, Andy hurried to the captain’s
desk and picked up an illustrated paper he had
seen there. As he held it before the boat
builder, he placed his finger on one of the pictures
and glanced at his companion with snapping
eyes.</p>

<p>“A flyin’ machine? An aeroplane?” the captain
almost shouted.</p>

<p>For answer, Andy’s hand shot up as if warning
silence. With the other he pointed toward
the bungalow.</p>

<p>“My mother,” he whispered significantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“See that?” he continued, pointing to the pictured
propeller. “And see that?” he added,
indicating the motor. “They are the only hard
things about an aeroplane. And we’ve got ’em
both!”</p>

<p>The captain’s mouth was wide open in amazement.
He scratched his chin and then suddenly
asked:</p>

<p>“Do you know how to make ’em?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” answered Andy all aglow, “but
the man who carved that propeller can build
anything he wants. I’ve got a book about
’em—‘How to Construct and Operate an
Aeroplane.’”</p>

<p>Perplexity shone on the captain’s face.</p>

<p>“Who’ll fly it?” he asked.</p>

<p>Andy smiled, and then slowly winked an eye.</p>

<p>“But your mother?” added the captain.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” answered the boy meaningly.
“You’re goin’ to make the machine; it’s goin’
to belong to you—which it will. You’ll have to
hire me to help. Why not? We’ll settle the
flyin’ business when we get to it. How about
it?” he concluded appealingly.</p>

<p>His companion shook his head.</p>

<p>“We’d need a lot of things we haven’t got—or
<em>I</em> would,” and he grinned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t need a thing but what’s right
here in sight,” pleaded Andy, “except some
cloth and steel wire.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we could get them up at Melbourne—or
<em>I</em> could,” conceded the captain, his
grin broadening into a laugh.</p>

<p>“Then it’s a go?” urged Andy.</p>

<p>“But I don’t see,” argued Captain Anderson
in new doubt, “just what benefit an aeroplane
will be to me if we could make it.”</p>

<p>“What good was the aero-catamaran to you?
You helped build that.”</p>

<p>The captain could only laugh outright.</p>

<p>“I reckon I did it just to be tinkerin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll get tinkerin’ to beat the band
buildin’ an airship,” exclaimed Andy. “Besides,
there ain’t any law against <em>you</em> takin’ a
ride in it.”</p>

<p>“Me?” exclaimed the captain. “Me? I’d
sail the <i>Valkaria</i> from here to the Pacific. But
I wouldn’t trust myself ten feet in one o’ these
sky craft.”</p>

<p>The boy followed him outside the boathouse.
They could see Mrs. Anderson and Andy’s
mother ready for the trip.</p>

<p>“But I have always been sort o’ interested
in aeroplanes—at long range. Bring me the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
book about ’em and I’ll read up a little,” added
the captain, locking the doors.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll think about it?” persisted the
boy.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” was the captain’s answer, “I’ll
<em>think</em> about it. But that isn’t promisin’.”</p>

<p>As Captain Anderson and Andy walked to
the pier to get the trundle-cart to carry the
trunks down to the landing, the boy was surprised
to see a colored man sitting on the edge
of the runway.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ba,” exclaimed the captain.
“You’re just in time, if you’re lookin’ for a
job to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yaas, sah, Ise yo’ honey,” replied the
negro. “Loafin’ don’t git yo’ nothin’ but
conch meat.”</p>

<p>Andy saw that the man had none of the
flashiness of most colored men. His cheek
bones were high, his skin was dusty black, his
tremendously muscled and unusually long arms
were in a marked contrast with his short bowed
legs, and he wore neither hat nor shoes.</p>

<p>“Go up to the house and get two trunks.
Then you can row us to Goat Creek.”</p>

<p>The man was off instantly.</p>

<p>“Ba?” said Andy. “That’s a peculiar
name!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“Short for Bahama,” explained the captain.
“That’s the only name he has. He’s a Bahama
man; turned up here a few years ago, and
been hangin’ around the river ever since.”</p>

<p>“Looks as if he might have just stepped out
of an African jungle.”</p>

<p>“His father probably did,” was the captain’s
answer.</p>

<p>Ba needed no truck for the transfer of the
trunks. He carried them to the pier, one at a
time, balanced on his woolly head. Then the two
ladies were seated in one boat and the other
was tied astern to carry Andy and the baggage.
But the negro, being a skilled waterman, took
the captain’s place in the forward boat and the
captain joined the boy in the other craft.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it great, mother?” called out Andy
from the rear boat. “Let’s stay all winter.”</p>

<p>“It is certainly beautiful,” answered his
mother. “I wish your father could be here.
But we can’t stay. You must get back to
school.”</p>

<p>The boy glanced slyly at Captain Anderson
and drew down his mouth dolefully.</p>

<p>“We ain’t got any time to waste on this
thing, Captain. Can’t we start her to-day?”
he whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” answered his companion, slowly,
“you can give me the book to-day. I’ll see
what I can make out of it. But—” and he
shook his head again.</p>

<p>Undaunted by the captain’s hesitation, Andy
fell into argument. He began with the simplicity
of the aeroplane mechanically, and insisted
that, aside from the engine and propeller, it
was even less complex than a bicycle.</p>

<p>“Why, every boy in the country’ll be makin’
’em. You need only some light, strong wood
and wires, and a few yards o’ varnished cloth,
and there you are. I’d take the engine home
and make one myself this summer, only I know
mother wouldn’t let me.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be sort of underhanded for me
to make it for you?”</p>

<p>“Make it for yourself!” stoutly urged the
boy. “Think of it! I can see her now—sailin’
off over that white beach o’ yours like a—a—”</p>

<p>“<i>Pelican</i>,” suggested the captain. “That’s
our bird down here.”</p>

<p>“<i>Pelican</i>—sure!” said Andy. “That’s a
great name—Captain Anderson’s <i>Pelican</i>. And
say,” he whispered, leaning forward, “if you’ll
do it, so far as mother’s concerned, I’ll give my
promise now never to try to fly in it until she
says I can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“That seems fair enough,” said the man
scratching his chin thoughtfully. After a few
moments, a peculiar smile shone on his face.
Then, very soberly, he said:</p>

<p>“Young man, did I understand you to say
you understood something about gas engines?”</p>

<p>Andy, mystified, opened his mouth.</p>

<p>“I—” he began.</p>

<p>“That’s what I understood,” said his questioner
solemnly. “Did I also understand you
to say you had some knowledge of the theory
of flying machines?”</p>

<p>Doubly perplexed, Andy’s jaw dropped
further.</p>

<p>“I—” he began once more.</p>

<p>“Very well,” went on Captain Anderson.
“Then it’s all settled. But I can’t pay you
over a dollar a day, and as money is scarce
down here, I’ll have to settle in some other
way. This is a pretty good boat we’re riding
in. It’s worth about ten dollars. I’ll give it
to you, and deliver it in advance, for ten days’
labor.”</p>

<p>A yell rent the air. Mrs. Leighton and Mrs.
Anderson whirled about regardless of their
equilibrium.</p>

<p>“Andrew,” cried his mother, “what’s the
matter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing, mother. Only I’ve just made a
good bargain. I’ve just bought this boat.”</p>

<p>“Bought it?” called back his mother.</p>

<p>“Yes—for ten dollars. We needed it.”</p>

<p>“And he’s going to work it out,” explained
Captain Anderson. “I can use him whenever
you can spare him.”</p>

<p>“That’s very good of you,” responded Mrs.
Leighton. “But please don’t pay him more
than he is worth.”</p>

<p>The only way by which Andy could show his
gratitude and appreciation was to pat the captain
affectionately on the arm, and then the
mouth of Goat Creek was reached.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Andy was assisting his
mother up the path leading to the little estate
of his late uncle, Abner Leighton. Then he
sprang down the path again to help Ba with the
trunks. His thoughts were not on oranges, nor
pineapples, nor his late uncle’s house. Nor
did he pause to think of the laboratory shop
and the power generator. A certain red book
in one of the trunks, “How to Construct and
Operate an Aeroplane,” blotted out all these.</p>

<p>“Andrew,” called out his mother, with a
laugh, “I think I see one thing, already, that
we’ll have to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s that, mother?” panted the boy, as
he tugged at his trunk strap.</p>

<p>“The house needs painting badly. I’ll have
you do that first.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE HOME OF THE ECCENTRIC EXPERIMENTER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Any lingering interest that Andy might have
had in his uncle’s place disappeared, temporarily,
on the spot. He had figured that he
might have trouble in arranging things so that
he could help about the place and yet find time
to help build an aeroplane. To be sentenced
to “paint the house” was more than he had
bargained for. The boy was in despair.</p>

<p>But as they approached the house, his interest
began to revive. When he saw that his
uncle’s home was a substantial little building,
backed by a grove of golden-studded orange
trees, he began to forget his new trouble.</p>

<p>The house, two stories high, with a porch or
gallery on two sides, stood on open ground.</p>

<p>“From the second story,” explained Captain
Anderson, “it looks out over the river. You
can even see the spray of the ocean breakers on
the other side of the peninsula, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“The sea?” exclaimed Andy.</p>

<p>“And miles up and down the river,” replied
the captain, nodding his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The place contained about twenty acres, of
which five in the rear were in oranges and one
in pineapples. On the slope in front was a garden
patch, while the low ground near the creek
was a swamp.</p>

<p>“It is so much more than I expected,” exclaimed
Mrs. Leighton at once, “that I almost
wish we could keep it and live here.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we could afford it, mother?”
Andy began. “I don’t think father will come
down here.”</p>

<p>“What is it worth, Captain?” asked Mrs.
Leighton.</p>

<p>“About two thousand dollars—maybe a little
less.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Andy, “of course, we ought
to clean up around here a little, but I don’t
think we should spend any money on paint or
repairs until father knows all about it. Let’s
write to him.”</p>

<p>That meant perhaps a week’s reprieve. In
that time considerable might be done on the
projected flying machine.</p>

<p>“We’ll see,” answered his mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leighton and Andy entered the place
with great curiosity. The front of the house
was one living room of undecorated pine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
There was a stove standing in a box of sand,
and a long table, a couch, and bookshelves built
in the end of the room. A chair at the table and
a handmade lounging chair with a canvas back
were the only seating accommodations.</p>

<p>The table bore a big green-shaded student
lamp, and was laden with books, pamphlets,
magazines—all in order in little racks—and, in
the center, a heap of blank books, scratch paper
pads, dry ink bottles, pens, tobacco jars, pipes,
matches, and newspaper clippings. On the
walls, here and there, were attractive colored
prints.</p>

<p>On the table Andy noticed several foreign
magazines and reviews. A large portion of the
contents of the bookcases were European scientific
magazines. One of these, turned over on
the table, was a German periodical devoted to
chemistry.</p>

<p>On the far side of the room a steep stairway
led to the second floor. While his elders ascended
to the rooms above the boy opened a
door in the rear. The scientific publications
had instantly revived his curiosity concerning
the shop or workroom. The door led into a
small, bare room with a door opening on the
side gallery—evidently a dining room. Beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
this, was a kitchen and a door leading out on
the orange grove.</p>

<p>A few yards within the grove, the boy found,
in a clearing, the building that his uncle had
used as a shop. It was of weather-worn boards,
and had a tar-paper roof. The windows, on
two sides of the shed, were almost continuous,
and protected by shutters. The door, on a windowless
side, was fastened with a padlock. But
this did not long deter the curious Andy. Many
kinds of pipe, bars of iron, empty carboys,
boards, boxes, and barrels of hard and soft coal
were about the shed. Catching up a piece of
bar iron, Andy demolished the lock staple with
a blow.</p>

<p>The spaces between the board siding had
been filled in with laths and, as the shutters
were closed, it was a moment or two before the
prying visitor could make out his surroundings.
As he began to do so he knew that Captain Anderson’s
suggestions were more than justified.
He was plainly in the workroom of an experimenter
of wide scope.</p>

<p>The intruder’s first work was to throw open
the wooden shutters. Then, despite the dust-covered
windows, he began a quick inventory of
the place. The side where there were no windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
looked like the disordered shelves of a
country drug store. Glass bottles and smaller
vials, wicker demijohns, and labeled boxes were
jammed together in confusion. There was an
acid, mouldy smell about the place, as if sunshine
and air had not entered for a long time.</p>

<p>Beneath the windows on the long side of the
room was a little workbench such as watchmakers
use. It was littered with tools looking much
like a watchmaker’s outfit. In a cleared place
on it was tacked a sheet of paper, now brown
with dust. In lead pencil, on this, were chemical
formulae and algebraical equations. By its
side was a box of drawing instruments, steel
rules, drawing curves and dividers, with pens
and drawing inks.</p>

<p><a href="#i_p057">“Nothing much doing!”</a> chuckled Andy to
himself, smacking his lips. He reveled in
places of this character. It meant many possible
hours of prolonged examination and the
joy of almost any kind of discovery.</p>

<p>On the right of this bench was a heavier one
for metal working, with two vises and a lathe
operated by shaft and pulley. The shaft extended
through the side of the room and connected
with a small gasoline engine outside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58-<br />59]</a></span></p>

<p>Continuing his hasty survey of the curious
laboratory, Andy faced the other windowed
side of the room. Crowded into a corner, he
made out a portable forge. Next to it, was an
anvil with hammers, tongs, and bending blocks.
Next to this was another and still heavier
bench.</p>

<p>It was the first close view of this that made
Andy spring forward as if he had caught sight
of a bed of gold nuggets. Hereon, plainly
enough, were the physical expressions of the eccentric
experimenter’s peculiar ideas. Metal
wheels, shafts, springs, cylinders, and pistons
were heaped together. In front of them was a
wooden, soot-smeared and oil-begrimed miniature
model of something. The little model had
somewhat the appearance of a mechanical fan.
As Andy picked it up, a voice from behind him
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Couldn’t wait, eh?”</p>

<p>It was Captain Anderson, and he was followed
by Mrs. Leighton and Mrs. Anderson.</p>

<p>“Where’s that power generator or transformer,
or whatever it is?” was Andy’s only
answer as he replaced the model.</p>

<p>“Andrew!” exclaimed his mother, as she
caught sight of the boy, whose face was
streaked with dust and perspiration, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
whose coat was already covered with cobwebs.
“You’re ruining your best suit. Come out of
that dirty place.”</p>

<p>The boy did so, but it was partly because
Captain Anderson had motioned him around
the shed. There, beneath a lean-to protection,
was a fourth bench. On this, even the untrained
Andy instantly made out six small
cylinders connected by steel tubes, in the center
of each of which was an arrangement of
valves and stop cocks. Attached to the first of
the cylinders was a compact device resembling
a blower, operated by a hand crank. From
this, a steel tube led below the bench.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me what it is,” exclaimed Captain
Anderson. “All I know about it is your
uncle said that when he got those cylinders
workin’ right, he’d have no more use for gasoline.”</p>

<p>“Looks like a new kind o’ compressor,” began
Andy, his face beaming. “I think I—”</p>

<p>“Andy, come right along up to the house and
help us get things in order,” commanded his
mother. “Did you ever see so much rubbish?”
she added, turning to Mrs. Anderson and gathering
up her skirts anew. “All this stuff must
have cost a lot of money. Is it worth anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
now?” she asked, peering timidly into the disorderly
shop once more.</p>

<p>“The tools are worth something,” answered
Captain Anderson. “As for the other things,
I guess they ain’t good for anything except
junk.”</p>

<p>They were on their way back to the house,
Andy tagging behind and thinking. Finally he
touched the captain on the arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t you be too sure about that ‘junk’
business.”</p>

<p>“Did you find anything?” asked the captain,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“I didn’t,” answered the boy, “but my uncle
didn’t keep that place goin’ just to kill time.
You can bet there are ideas buried somewhere
in that stuff.”</p>

<p>“And you are goin’ to dig ’em up?” laughed
Captain Anderson.</p>

<p>“There ain’t any law against tryin’,” retorted
Andy, red in the face, “and if my
mother tries to sell that shanty or the ‘junk’ in
it before I’m through with it, she’s agoin’ to
strike a snag.”</p>

<p>The negro, Ba, had carried the trunks to the
gallery, where a council was now held. The
only food in the house was a few tins of fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and vegetables and some ant-infested sugar.
The entire place was much in need of soap,
water, and broom. The bedding did not meet
Mrs. Leighton’s approval. Besides, there was
but one bed in the house.</p>

<p>The boy’s suggestion to his mother was to
“camp out” in the house until the next morning.
There were preserved peaches and tinned
baked beans in the pantry, to say nothing of
oranges and pineapples on the place, and these
Andy thought quite sufficient in the way of
food. Then, on the following day, they would
borrow Captain Anderson’s sailboat and go to
Melbourne to lay in supplies.</p>

<p>This suggestion receiving no immediate objection,
the boy began to exercise his growing
energy in his attack on the disorderly floor of
the big room. In the midst of this Captain
Anderson stopped him.</p>

<p>“You can’t stay here,” explained the elder.
“Your mother has agreed with us, and you’re
going back to our house.”</p>

<p>A look of disappointment spread over the
boy’s face. Then this changed as he turned to
his mother.</p>

<p>“Then you ain’t goin’ to paint the house
right away?”</p>

<p>“Not at once,” was the answer. “Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Anderson has kindly offered to let us board
with him for a few days until we hear from
your father. Then, if he wants to sell the
house, and we can’t do it at once, we may make
arrangements to come here and live.”</p>

<p>Although it had been decided to return to
Captain Anderson’s home, and the trunks were
carried back to the boat at once, it was nearly
noon before the party prepared to leave. Two
hours were spent in looking over the grove and
the pineapple field, and in a more careful survey
of the house and its contents. Then Captain
Anderson prepared to lock the house
again.</p>

<p>“Don’t that road lead to your house?” asked
Andy, who had been in new thought for some
time, addressing the captain.</p>

<p>“Sure,” laughed Captain Anderson, “want
to walk? It’s two miles.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” asked Andy, “do you mind if I
stay here awhile? I’ll walk back.”</p>

<p>His mother eyed him suspiciously.</p>

<p>“What are you planning to do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Just want to nose around—books and
things,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Can he do any harm?” Mrs. Leighton
asked, with a smile. “I guess it’s ‘things’
more than books.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let him stay,” urged the captain. “The
place needs all the airing it can get.”</p>

<p>As soon as Andy saw that his request had
been granted, he hurried to the boats and
opened his trunk. He soon extracted a little red
volume. As the returning party approached,
he slipped the book to Captain Anderson.</p>

<p>“Captain,” he said quietly, “here’s the book
you wanted to see. I thought you might look
at it this afternoon. Things are workin’ all
right,” he added winking slyly. “I’m on the
job to begin earning that boat to-morrow—”</p>

<p>“What book is that?” interrupted Mrs.
Leighton, who had her eyes on her son.</p>

<p>Andy hesitated, but Captain Anderson volunteered:</p>

<p>“It’s a book about aeroplanes. He’s lending
it to me.”</p>

<p>“Aeroplanes?” exclaimed Mrs. Leighton instantly,
turning to her son. Then, looking at
the captain, she added: “I hope you’ll keep it,
Captain Anderson. Andy wasted one whole
summer on an engine that won’t work. We
don’t need any aeroplanes of the same kind.”
Turning to Andy again, she said: “Be sure and
be at Captain Anderson’s by five o’clock—and
take in all that bedding before you leave.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>AN UNFINISHED LETTER SOLVES A MYSTERY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Before the boats disappeared, Andy was
hurrying up the hill.</p>

<p>“Talk about your hidden treasure!” said the
boy to himself. “Lookin’ for concealed ideas
beats it all hollow. Now for the steel cylinders—whatever
they are.”</p>

<p>Passing the pump in the rear of the house,
he realized that he was thirsty, and that reminded
him that he was hungry. He thought
first of the canned peaches and beans. Then he
recalled the ripe oranges and pineapples. Ten
minutes later, his face and fingers redolent of
the combined juice of the two fruits, he was
ready for his inviting investigation.</p>

<p>Throwing off his hat and coat, he sought,
first, the bench behind the shop. He secured
wrenches and screw-drivers and loosened some
of the parts of the six cylinder machine. But,
after all, he had to shake his head.</p>

<p>“Looks as if it is <em>almost</em> something,” he
mused. “And it looks too as if it had <em>nearly</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
worked. But I reckon it didn’t. And, if my
uncle couldn’t make it go, what’s the use o’
my tryin’?”</p>

<p>Plainly it was a gas accumulator or condenser
of some kind. It even suggested an attempt
to make a device for liquefying gases.
The parts were so rusted that even after oiling
them, Andy could not operate them.</p>

<p>“I’ll pass that up for to-day,” thought the
boy finally, his face wet with perspiration and
his hands greasy with oil and brown from the
rust. “Now for the little model!”</p>

<p>He had a theory about the cylinders, but he
had none about the model. In appearance, it
resembled a wooden fan that the boy had once
seen—a fan made by slitting half of a bit of
straight-grained pine and then spreading the
slit sections out like over-lapping feathers. In
a way, too, it resembled a bird’s tail. The device
to which the fan-like pieces were attached
was so contrived as to open and close the tail-like
extension.</p>

<p>Andy carried the contrivance into the sunlight
and carefully cleaned it. Then, by grasping
the central wooden shaft with a pair of
pliers, he found he was able to turn it. A little
brass cogwheel on the shaft operated in two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
smaller wheels, one on each side. These, working
on a beveled gear, moved levers simultaneously
but in opposite directions. It required
but a few minutes to discover that turning the
shaft to the right drew down the fan-like blades
on the right-hand side of the tail-like part and,
at the same time, elevated those on the left-hand
side.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s a toy,” argued the boy.
“Maybe the inside of an automatic bird. Anyway,
it works just as a bird spreads its tail
when flying.”</p>

<p>Further examining the miniature combination
of wood and brass, Andy made another
discovery: the shaft not only turned both ways,
but it, the beveled gears, and the connecting
levers, worked forward and back. As the boy
pushed the shaft backward, all the sheaves of
the tail-like extension flew upward.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> a bird,” exclaimed Andy. “It moves
like a pigeon’s tail when the bird starts flying.”</p>

<p>Pulling the shaft forward, reversed the operation,
and the sheaves dropped downward.</p>

<p>“There she is comin’ down,” the boy cried
aloud. “I’ve got it. It’s a new kind o’ boat
rudder.”</p>

<p>What increased the resemblance to a bird’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
tail was another ingenious device—two rows of
small cones just above and below the narrow
ends of the sheaves. Each blade, working upon
a universal hinge, was free to move to the right
and left. As they rose or fell under the pressure
of the shaft, they pressed on the cones and
spread out, fanwise.</p>

<p>Then came the crowning discovery. The
shaft could be moved forward or back and
turned at the same time. As Andy pushed it
backward and gave it a twist to the right, the
feather-like leaves depressed, assumed a diagonal
line and spread out like a bird darting to
the earth.</p>

<p>“Old junk, is it?” muttered the boy, as he
carried the model into the shop again. “Maybe
so. But, junk or not, I’ll bet there’s never
been anything like that made before. And I’m
goin’ to find out what it’s for.”</p>

<p>Although Andy had only partly investigated
the fascinating mystery of the shop, he suddenly
determined to have another look at the
contents of the house. He was excited, hot, and
dust-covered. Passing through the dining
room, an unopened bottle of lime juice in the
cupboard caught his eye.</p>

<p>“Might as well refresh myself,” chuckled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Andy, with a boy’s hot-weather thirst. “A little
Florida ‘cup’ is just about my size on a day
like this,” he went on; and rushing out to the
grove, he secured three oranges and a small
pineapple. A big glass pitcher was filled with
fresh water. Into this, using his pocketknife,
Andy sliced the fruit, and then on it poured a
cup of lime juice, after which he took up the
sugar box. It was alive with ants.</p>

<p>Spreading a newspaper on the table, the boy
poured out a quantity of sugar. The ants did
not abandon their banquet. They rolled out
with the sugar. The boy scratched his head.
Then he tried to chase the ants away. They
were not easily chased. He got a little stick
and began pushing them off the sugar. They
went off one side and returned on the other.
From scratching his head, Andy fell to rubbing
his chin. Then he had a great thought.</p>

<p>“I’ll drown ’em,” he said to himself.</p>

<p>Finding a shallow dish, the thirsty boy
poured the sugar into it. The ants clung to
their feast. He ran to the pump with the dish
and filled it with water. The persistent ants
were defeated. Those that did not escape the
deluge by hasty flight were drowned at once,
victims of their appetites. In a few moments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the top of the syrupy bath was thick with overcome
ants. A few sweeps of the surface with
his hand, and Andy was free of his enemies.</p>

<p>“An’ I’ve got all the sugar without a speck
o’ ants,” he chuckled again.</p>

<p>Dumping the sweetening into the pitcher the
boy stirred up the mess.</p>

<p>“It tastes awful good,” he said to himself,
“but it’s kind o’ sweet.”</p>

<p>Just then a big brown ant floated out from
under a raft-like slice of pineapple.</p>

<p>“But I reckon plain water’s pretty good on
a hot day,” he added less enthusiastically.
Dropping the pitcher of Florida ‘cup,’ Andy
hastened to the pump and took a deep drink of
pure water.</p>

<p>Refreshed, he began systematically examining
the living room. The bookshelves afforded
a rich mine. From these, he advanced to the
table where, manifestly, his uncle had done his
reading and writing.</p>

<p>There was scarcely a thing here that did not
give Andy a new thrill of joy. Everything
seemed covered with writing or figures; sheets
of paper, record books, piles of letters, engineering
cross-ruled paper. One after another
was put aside for later examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Andy came unexpectedly upon that
which afterwards meant so much to him: the
instant explanation of the puzzle of the little
model. Opening a pad of letter paper, he saw
written in a careful hand, several pages addressed
to Mr. Octave Chanute, of Chicago.</p>

<p>Andy knew Mr. Chanute by reputation to be
a skilled engineer and the father of airship experiments
in America. He knew that it was
Mr. Chanute’s experiments with kites and gliders
on the sand dunes of Indiana that had first
interested the Wright brothers, and the boy
glowed with pride to know that his uncle had
been in correspondence with such a man.</p>

<p>The letter that the boy found he read breathlessly—it
was dated at least two weeks before
his uncle’s death—and had not been mailed because
it had not been finished. When the boy
had read it twice and then stood, his eyes wide
and his heart throbbing wildly, he made the
resolution that he never wavered from, that
turned the possibility of the making of an aeroplane
into an insistent determination out of
which came the <i>Pelican</i> in which Andy had his
great adventure and in which he sought to
solve, and did solve the mystery of the Great
Pink Pearl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The momentous letter read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">“<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Chanute</span>:<br /></p>

<p>“I am glad you received safely the report of
my observations on bird flight in this region.
As I told you, I spent three days in the vicinity
of Pelican Island making notes on, and photographs
of, the movements of these birds in the
air. I hope the report will be of some assistance
to you in your inquiry into the problem of
‘soaring birds.’ One thing we all know, and
that is that birds <em>do</em> rise or soar at times without
any apparent movement of wings, tail, or
feathers. How this is done is, of course, a
puzzle to us all. Your theory that even in seemingly
calm weather, when there is no noticeable
agitation of the atmosphere, there may be a
vertical column of rising air induced by imperceptible
movements of the lower atmosphere,
may be the explanation.</p>

<p>“I believe, as you do, that when we have
found the explanation of how a bird ascends
without the use of its wings, we will have made
the longest step in conquering man-flight in the
air.</p>

<p>“While it has no bearing on your present
line of investigation, I cannot resist telling you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that the observations you asked me to make for
you have greatly interested me in the subject
of aviation in general. Always a dabbler in
physics and fond of experimenting, I have been
led into working out an idea of my own. While
watching the flight of birds, I could not but be
astonished at the wide difference between their
tail motions and the rear rudder or tail of the
aeroplanes as I have observed them in magazine
pictures.</p>

<p>“I was so much impressed by this lack of resemblance
that I yielded to the temptation to
try to adapt the natural apparatus of the bird
to man’s artificial flyer. I have even made a
small model of a guiding tail or rudder for
aeroplanes, patterned as nearly as practicable
after a bird’s tail. Of course, I have no means
of knowing how such an apparatus will work,
but later I mean to send you some drawings,
that you are at liberty to utilize as you see fit.</p>

<p>“These drawings will explain themselves.
My object has been to secure a guiding contrivance
that will not only alter the course of
an aeroplane, but will at the same time equalize
the darting tendency that I understand always
follows a sudden turn to right or left.
With it, I hope to lessen the need of flexing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
main planes of the machine when the rear rudder
is used, a large part of the tendency to dart
being absorbed, in theory at least, by the double
action of my bird-tail rudder. The moving machine
I hope may not only be steered up or
down, or right and left, but one motion of the
shaft will give the two movements which now
must be made independently.”</p></div>

<p>Here the letter came to an abrupt end.</p>

<p>“I knew it!” shouted Andy. “I knew it was
a rudder of some kind. It ain’t all clear to me
yet. But one thing <em>is</em> clear enough. I can make
a copy of that model. If it works, I’ll finish
that letter. But, if it does, the plans of it
aren’t goin’ to anyone ‘to do as he likes’ with
’em. I’ll have her patented.”</p>

<p>Leaving the doors open, Andy raced through
the house, and in a moment or two had again
disappeared within the shop in the grove.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE FIRM OF LEIGHTON &amp; ANDERSON IS FORMED</small></h2>
</div>


<p>When the coming night fairly forced the enthusiastic
boy from the shop, which he closed
and made secure by driving the lock staple into
the door jam again, Andy was a curious sight.
With his coat on his arm, his shirt wet with
perspiration, his hat and trousers smeared with
dust, oil, and rust, his hands black and his
knuckles bleeding from handling iron, wood,
and tools—all of which he inspected, felt of,
and stowed away again—he looked more like
a helper in a machine shop than a newly-arrived
Florida tourist.</p>

<p>By the time he reached the railroad on his
way home, it was dark. The sight of an approaching
lantern did not reassure him. When
he saw that it was Captain Anderson, he broke
out at once:</p>

<p>“It’s all settled! I don’t care about that
gas accumulator or compressor, or whatever it
is—we’ve got her tail!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Her tail?” queried the captain. “Whose
tail?”</p>

<p>“Why, the airship,” sang out Andy. “We’re
goin’ to have the best one ever made. We’ve
got a tail for it—a guider. Did you read the
book?”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that now,” admonished
the captain. “You’d better be thinkin’ of some
good reason why you stayed so long. Your
mother’s a good deal put out.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been a lookin’ over things,” explained
the boy. “My uncle must ’a been a wonder.
That little model is the greatest invention of
the age—”</p>

<p>“You’d better invent a model of an excuse
for your mother.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Your mother had an idea that an alligator
might have eaten you.”</p>

<p>But Andy’s look of disgust disappeared in
the other things he had on his mind.</p>

<p>“How about it?” he persisted. “Are we
goin’ to make the flyin’ machine?”</p>

<p>“That’s quite a job,” answered the captain.
“But I’ve been reading your book.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you do it?” exclaimed Andy.</p>

<p>“I reckon I could,” conceded Captain
Anderson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t need the rudder that you see in
the book,” broke in the boy. “The thing I’m
tellin’ you about is goin’ to take its place. I’ll
make it up there in my uncle’s shop.”</p>

<p>“If—?” said the captain, with a smile.</p>

<p>“If what?” asked Andy, alarmed.</p>

<p>“If your mother’ll let you,” was his friend’s
reply.</p>

<p>Andy was silent a moment as the two hurried
forward toward the house. Finally, with decision,
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Well, she will. It’ll be a shame if she
don’t.”</p>

<p>Captain Anderson seemed amused, but not
wholly convinced.</p>

<p>“I kind o’ glanced through the book, and I
was sort o’ plannin’ if I had the stuff—”</p>

<p>“And haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Pretty much all, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Then you are goin’ to do it; you will, won’t
you?” pleaded the lad.</p>

<p>“Are you certain that engine’s all right?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” shouted the boy; “why not? And
I’ll make the tail rudder! Hurrah!”</p>

<p>The captain laid his hand on Andy’s arm.</p>

<p>“Don’t get excited. I don’t want to do anything
your mother might not like—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“You leave that to me,” said the boy.
“She’ll agree—in the end.”</p>

<p>But it looked as if Andy might have a pretty
hard time placating his parent, judging by
his reception. Mrs. Leighton was genuinely
alarmed, but supper being ready and it being
apparent to the eye that her son was uninjured
by alligators, her pent-up lecture gradually lessened
into a mild criticism. When the boy, with
clean face and plastered hair, joined the others
at the table, Mrs. Leighton postponed further
admonition.</p>

<p>Mrs. Anderson’s Indian River oysters baked
in the shell were sufficient to put everyone in
a good humor. To Andy’s great relief, his
mother announced that she had devoted the
afternoon to writing letters: one to Mr. Leighton;
another to the bank in Melbourne, in relation
to her late brother’s affairs; and a third to
a man in the same town who, her host had informed
her, was a possible purchaser.</p>

<p>“Until I hear from your father,” she informed
her son, “we will do nothing.”</p>

<p>Andy nodded approvingly, but there was
much secret joy that he did not have to return
at once; that he was free, for a time, to get his
great project under way. The next thing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to acquaint his mother with the aeroplane idea
and to work himself into the scheme without
arousing his mother’s objection. As he ate, his
brain was busy with a dozen ideas. They were
rejected one after another, because each called
for deception.</p>

<p>Finally, with no definite idea in mind, he repeated
the story of the rudder model. With a
wealth of detail and a dramatic climax, the boy
worked his narrative up to the unmailed letter.</p>

<p>“And what makes me sorry,” he concluded,
“is that there it is, the very thing all flyin’ machines
need most. And nothin’ to come of it.”</p>

<p>“Why, that ought to be a patent,” suggested
Mrs. Anderson.</p>

<p>“A patent?” repeated Mrs. Leighton.
“Maybe there’s a fortune in it.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” remarked Andy. “But maybe it
won’t do what uncle figured it will. A thing
that won’t work ain’t much good if it is
patented.”</p>

<p>“We ought to try it,” declared Captain Anderson
earnestly. Then he added: “Let me
have the model, Mrs. Leighton, and I’ll make a
full-sized working copy.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure that would be putting you to a lot
of trouble,” replied that lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides,” interposed Mrs. Anderson, “how
are you going to test it after you get it?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Captain Anderson answered at last,
“it looks to me as if it might be worth the
trouble of a real test, even if I had to make a
machine to test it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean an aeroplane?” broke in
Mrs. Leighton.</p>

<p>“They’re very simple,” answered the captain,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p>“All that work to test a little model!” ejaculated
Andy’s mother. “All that trouble to see
if an idea is worth anything!”</p>

<p>“It would be some trouble,” explained the
captain, “but you don’t get anything without
some trouble—”</p>

<p>“I can help him, mother,” interrupted Andy,
trying to suppress his eagerness.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Leighton shook her head, and the
boy’s hopes died. Then his mother turned to
the captain with a suggestion.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t consent to that,” she began, “because
Andy is too young to give much assistance.
But, if you’ll let Mr. Leighton pay
you—”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we can do,” exclaimed
the boy, with new hope. “Let’s go havers. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Captain Anderson can make a thing out of that
model that will guide an aeroplane, it’ll surely
be worth something. Let’s all go partners:
we’ll take half because it’s uncle’s idea, and
Captain Anderson’ll take half because he
works it out.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Leighton looked questioningly at her
host.</p>

<p>“That’s fair enough,” answered the captain.
“But there’s one objection. I don’t know
much about engines. Andy knows all about
’em—”</p>

<p>“He knows a lot about one that won’t run,”
recalled his mother with a smile.</p>

<p>“He knows enough,” observed Captain Anderson
significantly. “If you can spare Andy
for a week or so to help me, I’ll go partners,
and we’ll see what we can do.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure that is awfully good of you,” exclaimed
Mrs. Leighton, “and if you really think
Andy can be of assistance, why, of course—”</p>

<p>“But who’s going to fly the thing?” broke in
Mrs. Anderson. “Not you,” she added, nodding
toward her husband.</p>

<p>Andy’s heart sank.</p>

<p>“It’ll be time enough to bother about that
when we need an operator,” laughed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
husband. “What’s the matter with Ba? He’s
afraid of nothing.”</p>

<p>“And sail away to the Bahamas, maybe,” replied
Mrs. Anderson.</p>

<p>The possibility of Andy becoming the aviator
seemed not to have occurred to Mrs. Leighton.
At her silence, the boy could hardly restrain a
yell of delight over the adroit way in which
Captain Anderson had managed the thing. As
he half rose from the table, Mrs. Anderson’s
words fell on his ears.</p>

<p>“Sail away to the Bahamas!”</p>

<p>He dropped back into his chair, his mouth
open.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Andy?” asked his
mother.</p>

<p>“Matter?” repeated the boy absently.</p>

<p>“Yes. What is the matter with you? Are
you ill?”</p>

<p>“Ill?” repeated Andy with a smile. “No. I
was just thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“Thinking? About what?”</p>

<p>“Just thinkin’ how funny that’d be—old Ba
asailin’ back to his home in the Bahamas in an
aeroplane.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Leighton, with a curious look at Andy,
at last turned to Captain Anderson and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“It will be awfully good of you to do that,
and I’ll make Andy do all he can to help you.
Only,” and she smiled, “I hope, if you make an
aeroplane, you’ll promise you won’t try to sail
it and that you won’t let Mr. Ba risk himself
in it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll promise,” replied Captain Anderson
with a laugh. “And now, if the ladies will excuse
us, I think I’ll go over to the boathouse
and have a pipe, and Andy can come along to
talk over the project. You aren’t too sleepy,
are you?” he added mischievously.</p>

<p>“I am pretty tired,” answered Andy, with a
yawn, “but I’d like to come for a little while.”</p>

<p>When the man and the boy had left the house,
Andy, instead of shouting for joy, said to his
companion very soberly:</p>

<p>“Captain Anderson, do you think I’ll ever
get a chance to sail that aeroplane?”</p>

<p>“What else are we makin’ it for?” grunted
the elder.</p>

<p>About half past ten, Mrs. Leighton and Mrs.
Anderson appeared at the door of the boathouse.
Captain Anderson and Andy, coatless,
the former with his exhausted pipe in his mouth,
were leaning over a drawing board and talking
in low tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought you only wanted a pipe,” began
Mrs. Anderson.</p>

<p>“And I thought you were tired,” added Mrs.
Leighton.</p>

<p>“Here she is,” exclaimed Captain Anderson,
rising and exhibiting the drawing board on
which Andy had roughly drawn the model of
his uncle’s rudder, “the celebrated ‘Aeroplane
bird-tail rudder, patent applied for, manufactured
by Leighton &amp; Anderson, Valkaria,
Florida.’”</p>

<p>“I hope it isn’t another aero-catamaran,”
commented Mrs. Anderson, with a smile.</p>

<p>As the ladies returned to the house and Andy
prepared to close the boathouse, he paused a
moment.</p>

<p>“Do you think he could, Captain Anderson?”</p>

<p>“Who could what?”</p>

<p>“Do you think Ba, or anyone else, could fly
to the Bahamas in an aeroplane?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether they could or not,”
answered the captain, blowing out the light,
“but I do know that’d be my idea of a real fool
trick.”</p>

<p>“Captain Anderson,” continued Andy, as
they walked slowly toward the house, “I’ve
just been tryin’ to figure out all that’s happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
since we saw your lantern comin’ to meet
us last night. Our engine may not go, and the
bird-tail rudder may not work, and the aeroplane
we’re goin’ to make may not fly, but I
reckon I’ve found one thing in the time we’ve
been here that there ain’t agoin’ to be anything
wrong about.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked the good-natured
boat builder.</p>

<p>“You,” answered Andy promptly.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>ANDY FIRST HEARS OF KING CAJOU</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Before ten o’clock the next morning, Andy,
with the savage-looking Ba rowing the little
<i>Red Bird</i>, had been to the Leighton cottage on
Goat Creek, and was back with the model of the
bird-tail guide and a box of special metal-working
tools. By noon the projected aeroplane was
under way.</p>

<p>While daylight lasted, Captain Anderson and
his assistant applied themselves to selecting
timber, roughing out the frame of the flying
machine, with frequent conferences. From
Andy’s handbook, dimensions were readily secured,
and that evening a working sketch of the
car was made.</p>

<p>The following morning, Andy began a search
for batteries. Those found at his uncle’s cottage
were practically exhausted. There was
much that the boy would have to do at the forge
in his uncle’s shop in the way of metal work,
but he was anxious that the batteries should be
secured to test the engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll have to get cloth, too, for covering
the planes. We ought to have balloon silk, but
that is out of the question. Good muslin will
do—we’ll waterproof it—I know how—alum
and sugar of lead, equal parts in warm
water—”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we haven’t muslin enough,” interrupted
the captain.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” exclaimed the boy, “nor
alum, nor sugar of lead, nor batteries. So I’ll
go to Melbourne this afternoon and get ’em—it’s
only eight miles. I can be back this
evening—”</p>

<p>“There’s a nice breeze,” volunteered the
captain, “and it’s abeam. We’ll have Ba sail
the <i>Valkaria</i>, and you can take your mother
and Mrs. Anderson.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you come along?” asked the boy,
overjoyed, but feeling a little guilty.</p>

<p>“When I get set on a job,” answered the industrious
captain, “I like to keep agoin’. I
ain’t goin’ to let this one get cold on my hands.
We’ve got to have those things, so hurry along
and get ’em.”</p>

<p>By one o’clock, the supply expedition set sail,
with a long list of needed material. In a half
hour, Mrs. Anderson and Mrs. Leighton being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
comfortably busy with their fancy work well up
in the bow, Andy found opportunity to interview
the mysterious Ba.</p>

<p>“Ba,” he began, “didn’t you like it over
there in the Bahamas?”</p>

<p>“Didn’ Ah like it? Ah liked it all right in
de big town—Ah liked it in Nassau, but dey
ain’t gwine ’low me stay dar.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“’Case I done had my trial.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?”</p>

<p>“Me? Ah don’ do nuthin’. Me an’ Robert
was in de sisal fiel’ and dar was de machete.
Dis Robert he done say de machete was hissen.
An’ I done rutch ober and tuck it to gib it to
him. An’ Robert he riz up an’ cut hissef on de
neck. Ah don’ do nuthin’.”</p>

<p>“Then what?” urged the interested boy.</p>

<p>“De big judge he jes look at me, an’ den dey
put me in de jail.”</p>

<p>“And you served your term?”</p>

<p>“Ah don’ know nothin’ ’bout dat. But Ah
pushed de bars out an’ Ah comed away.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you have a home?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>Ba shook his head, and his eyes widened.</p>

<p>“I ain’t gwine back to no out islands.”</p>

<p>“Out islands?” repeated Andy. “What are
they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>But Ba made no answer. He looked at the
boy with narrowed eyes, and then gave his
attention to the flying boat. After a few moments,
still ignoring the boy’s question, the
strange black man, without facing Andy and in
a new tone, said in a low voice:</p>

<p>“You ain’t nebber gwine on dat Timbado
Key, is you?”</p>

<p>“Timbado Key?” asked Andy. “Where’s
that?”</p>

<p>The slow-spoken Bahaman made no answer.</p>

<p>“Was that your home?” suggested the lad.</p>

<p>Again there was no immediate reply. Then,
suddenly, in a whisper, the black said:</p>

<p>“Dat’s fetich. You ain’t gwine dar?”</p>

<p>The boy nodded his head reassuringly. He
knew what “fetich” meant—the African’s sign
of ill-omen. Alarmed over a fetich! Finally
he went forward and asked Mrs. Anderson
what she knew about the blacks of the Bahamas.</p>

<p>She told him that they were mostly descended
from real Africans; that, in the days when
slave stealing was being practised, it was the
custom when slavers were caught by English or
American men-of-war, to liberate the victims
on the tropic Bahamas.</p>

<p>“There may be old men there now,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
said, “who were born in the wilds of Africa.
And the second and third generation are not
much more civilized. Ba is probably almost as
much African as if he were living in the
Congo,” she concluded.</p>

<p>“Where is Timbado Key?” asked Andy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Anderson shook her head. “All the
Bahama Islands, except Providence, are ‘out
islands.’ This must be one of the smaller ‘out
islands.’ I never heard of it.”</p>

<p>When the boy returned to the stern he again
attempted to learn from Ba why Timbado was
fetich, and where it was. But there was only
blankness on the boatman’s immobile face. In
a short time, Andy was to know a great deal
about Timbado Key, but for the time he had to
restrain his curiosity.</p>

<p>In Melbourne, Andy was greeted by a clerk
from the general store. He had a message
received by telephone from Captain Anderson.
In addition to the things the boy was to get,
there was a new list, which included more
straight-grained and knotless pine.</p>

<p>The rather delicate question of who was to
pay for the needed material might have embarrassed
the boy and his mother had not Captain
Anderson made it easy by assuming half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
expense as a partner and insisting on paying
for the other half until Mr. Leighton could send
a check for it.</p>

<p>The aeroplane architects were most anxious
to secure a quantity of No. 12 piano wire for
bracing the aeroplane, but as there was none
available, Andy took an entire roll of the same
size in plain steel. The next anxiety was that
they might not be able to find needed turn-buckles
for tightening the bracing wires. The
store had a few—a little larger than absolutely
necessary—and the town boatmaker had, fortunately,
enough more to fill out Andy’s list.</p>

<p>He searched the town for shoemaker’s twist,
but shoemaking seemed to have gone out of
style, and he had to content himself with what
approximated it, a skein of fine thread-like
linen cord used by fishermen in making nets.
As he could not get shoemaker’s wax to wax it,
he bought a cake of beeswax.</p>

<p>The selecting of the wood screws, which had
to be of various and exact sizes, was a task
that Andy relegated to the storekeeper while he
visited the lumber yard.</p>

<p>“Spruce is really what we want,” explained
the boy to the proprietor, who also ran the livery
stable, “but we’ll have to use pine—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Spruce?” exclaimed the dealer. “Then
I’m your boy, if this’ll do.” He led Andy to
a bundle of boards, 2 × 2 stuff, and some thin
rib-like slats. “This is spruce.”</p>

<p>“How’d you happen to have that down
here?” exclaimed Andy.</p>

<p>“I’ve had it two years,” answered the man.
“I got it for two college boys from Boston, who
were going to make two racin’ shells. But they
didn’t make nothin’ but a lot of bills and some
quick tracks.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take it all,” broke in Andy, highly
elated.</p>

<p>By five o’clock, the <i>Valkaria</i> was considerably
lower in the water. With a fine burst of
generosity, Andy conducted his mother and
Mrs. Anderson back to the store, regaled them
with some not over cold pop and a box of chocolates,
bought a can of smoking tobacco and some
new magazines for the captain, and with a
couple of two-for-a-nickel cigars for Ba, assisted
the ladies aboard the boat.</p>

<p>Ba was all smiles over the cigars. He appeared
all smiles over something else, too.</p>

<p>“What’s doin’, Ba?” joked Andy.</p>

<p>“Ain’t nothin’ doin’,” replied Ba, licking his
cigar preliminary to lighting it. “Leastways,
ain’t no wind. She’s a dead cam.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, so it is,” exclaimed Mrs. Anderson,
“and here it is five o’clock. Do you think it’ll
freshen up later, Ba?” she went on, with some
concern.</p>

<p>“Ain’t gwine be no win’ dis eben, Miss Anderson,”
was Ba’s verdict, as he rolled out an
odorous volume of smoke.</p>

<p>“What in the world shall we do?” cried Mrs.
Leighton.</p>

<p>Mrs. Anderson laughed.</p>

<p>“There isn’t any train, and we can’t walk.
Ba,” she said to the happy Bahaman, “you’ll
have to pole us home.”</p>

<p>The obedient darkey, without any great
gusto, however, began unlashing two long poles
that were made fast to the deck alongside the
washboard. Andy understood.</p>

<p>“Can you do that?” he asked. “Is the river
shallow enough?”</p>

<p>“The Indian River is like a lot of people,”
answered Mrs. Anderson, laughing. “It’s not
anyways as deep as it looks. And Captain Anderson
has one weakness—he’ll never leave his
boat if he goes sailing. He’ll come home in it
if he has to push it every foot of the way.
That’s why we’ve got the poles.”</p>

<p>Ba had already cast off and (having extinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
his cigar and stowed it away in his
pocket), was getting the <i>Valkaria</i> under way.
As the boat began to move, he walked along the
deck gangway to the bow, and dropping the end
of his twelve-foot pole to the bottom, rested the
other end against his shoulder and began to
walk aft. As he did so, the boat moved forward
under the pressure of Ba’s feet.</p>

<p>“Great!” shouted Andy, catching up the
other pole. “That’s fun. We’ll get you home
quicker’n a couple o’ canal boat mules.”</p>

<p>Ba did not protest. Showing Andy how to
alternate with him so that one of them was
pushing forward while the other was returning
to the bow, the colored man and the eager boy
soon had the little yacht moving on her course.</p>

<p>Andy’s black and blue shoulder was good
proof the next day that he did his share. Ba
crooned the songs of the “out islands” when
the time dragged, and at last, after eight
o’clock, Mrs. Anderson detected the pin-point
light of the lantern she knew Captain Anderson
would hang on the end of the pier.</p>

<p>The captain, receiving the tired stragglers
with many a joke, showed his skill as a cook in
the hot supper he had ready. The evening meal
disposed of, it was a new pleasure to Andy, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
spite of his stiff limbs and sore shoulder, to
help carry the aeroplane material to the boathouse,
and almost a supreme happiness to sit
in the light of the rising moon and recount all
his experiences to his friend.</p>

<p>After a time, Andy went into the house and
soon returned with the captain’s chart of the
Bahamas. Spreading it out on the desk, the
boy began studying it intently.</p>

<p>“Got it again?” asked the captain laughing.
“Well, I don’t blame you. They’re curious
islands—”</p>

<p>“Where’s Timbado Key?” interrupted
Andy.</p>

<p>“Timbado? Oh, I see! Old Ba has loosened
up. That’s Ba’s notion of a good place to keep
away from.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked the boy quickly. “He
wouldn’t tell me.”</p>

<p>“Nor me,” answered the captain, freshly
charging his pipe. “I’ve heard it’s a place
colored men never go back to a second time and
that white men never go to even once.”</p>

<p>Andy dropped the map, and Captain Anderson
walked over and picked it up. He pointed
to a nameless speck on the southern edge of the
Bahama Banks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s about here,” he indicated. “They told
me over on Andros Island, when I put in there
two years ago, that if you want to see real African
savagery, you don’t need to cross the ocean—just
go to Timbado.”</p>

<p>Andy’s eyes dilated.</p>

<p>“At other places there are white men, Englishmen
and Americans, growin’ fruit and
spongin’ and fishin’, but on Timbado, there’s
nothin’ doin’.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” interrupted the boy.</p>

<p>“Well,” went on the captain, “they <em>say</em>,
mind you I just say they <em>say</em>, that there is a
village o’ blacks over there bossed by an old
African who thinks he’s a king, King Cajou.
And,” laughed the captain, “they <em>say</em> that old
Cajou ain’t ever been cured o’ eatin’ his enemies—and
sometimes those who ain’t.”</p>

<small>A NEW IDEA IN AEROPLANES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>As Andy Leighton prepared for bed that
night, one idea possessed his mind. He would
in some manner penetrate Ba’s ignorance and
learn the story of Timbado Key and its king.</p>

<p>Then he fell asleep to dream of a tropic isle
whereon, beneath palms, a band of ghoulish
savages, black, and clad in skins and feathers,
knelt in groveling obeisance before a chief, their
king, the cannibal Cajou.</p>

<p>His brain was yet full of these things in the
morning, but the first smell of the shavings in
the shop was an antidote; Ba and Timbado, for
the moment, were put aside.</p>

<p>“Since I’ve got you started,” said Andy to
the captain, after an hour of replanning, “I
guess I’ll go over to my own factory. I’m
goin’ to make the wooden part of the tail guide
here, but I’ve got to do the metal work, the cogwheels,
shaft-guides, and lever joints on the
forge and lathe.”</p>

<p>This was Wednesday morning. Friday evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
when the <i>Red Bird</i> returned from the
Leighton cottage, it carried a box of shaft cogs
and other metal parts. In the shop that evening,
stood, in the rough, the frame of the future
car—Captain Anderson’s handiwork.</p>

<p>The spread of this frame was a little over
thirty-six feet, and, despite Andy’s fortunate
find of spruce, the four horizontal beams were
of pine, each cleverly spliced in three places
with one-quarter inch stove bolts to a short,
thinned under piece. But the stanchions holding
the two planes together, and the struts connecting
and bracing the front and back beams
were of spruce, as were all the rib pieces. Pine
weighs as much as spruce, but it is only five-eighths
as strong.</p>

<p>Captain Anderson, having acquainted himself
thoroughly with the plans, set about the
actual work of construction in his own manner.</p>

<p>The four car beams were each 36 feet, 4
inches long. They were to be the basis of a car
6 feet deep and 5 feet high. After two of the
light, slender beams had been laid on the floor,
and the eight struts had been laid across them,
the latter were made fast to the beams by liberal
coats of glue and close winding with the
waxed seine thread. The other beams were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
treated in the same manner. This required a
full day’s time, and the big, fragile-looking
frames were set aside to dry.</p>

<p>The next morning, Andy’s impatience to test
the engine could be no longer restrained.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of an aeroplane, if that
don’t work?” he argued.</p>

<p>The engine responded slowly when started,
stopped after a few revolutions, and then fell
to work with an exhaust of thick, black smoke.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” exclaimed the
captain.</p>

<p>“No trouble,” answered the boy. “It’s only
oil in the cylinders—it’ll be out in a short time.
She’s fine and dandy.”</p>

<p>With regret, Andy shut off the engine to help
with the other work. The task of connecting the
upper and lower frames was then undertaken.
Sixteen stanchions had been rounded and sandpapered
until the wind-friction-corners had
been removed. The ends of each of these had
been slightly slotted. They were then set upright
between the upper and lower frames, and,
after being liberally painted with glue, screwed
to the beams opposite each stanchion end. The
attached ends were carefully wrapped with the
seine thread, which was also glued, and another
day’s work was at an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kind o’ light and flimsy,” suggested the
captain, when they finally quit work.</p>

<p>“Sure,” admitted Andy. “It wouldn’t hold
at all that way. It won’t be rigid until we get
the wire braces on. Then we’ll tune her up
like a fiddle. This string and glue don’t do
much but hold the frame together until we get
the wires attached. They’ll brace her like a
bridge span.”</p>

<p>The sawing of the spruce strips for ribs—pieces
6 feet long by ¾ inch thick and an inch
wide—was the program for the next day. Captain
Anderson adjusted the small power circular
saw that was a part of his outfit, and
the roughing of the slender pieces was soon
accomplished. As each had to be delicately
planed, sandpapered, and shellacked, this job
ran into night again.</p>

<p>That evening, Mrs. Leighton began to wonder
if she might not get a letter from her husband
the next day in relation to the little estate
and its disposition.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” whispered Andy to his friend,
the captain. “He’ll likely put a crimp in my
airship plans.”</p>

<p>“Put a crimp in <em>your</em> airship plans?” repeated
Captain Anderson soberly. “What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
have you got to do with the airship? Aren’t
you working for me? It’s your father and I
who are partners.”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course,” replied the boy. “Of course—I
forgot. But he may not want me to work
on it.”</p>

<p>“That needn’t stop the work,” exclaimed the
captain. “I think I’ll go ahead just the same.
I reckon I’ve got a sort of interest in the engine,
and, as for the bird-tail rudder, I can give
that up if he wants it. But he won’t; he’s a
mechanic.”</p>

<p>The letter did not come the next day, but
when it did, in the middle of the following week,
it was even enthusiastic about the possibilities
of the discovered model, and congratulated
Mrs. Leighton on her good luck in being able
to make an arrangement with Captain Anderson
to work out the idea. It said nothing about
Andy’s work on the testing apparatus. This
was probably because of Mr. Leighton’s special
interest in his wife’s description of her brother’s
estate. How much this was, was indicated
by his suggestion that no part of the property
be sold, as he was arranging, if possible, to come
to Florida in about two weeks.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Leighton read this, Andy did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
“hurrah.” Instead, he made a quick calculation.
Then he smiled. In two weeks the aeroplane
would be completed, and <em>someone</em> would
have tested it.</p>

<p>There were over eighty ribs to be attached
to the two frames of the aeroplane. At intervals
of about a foot, the front end of each strip
was screwed to the top of the forward beam.
Extending the strip back over the rear beam,
it was made fast there with screws. Two feet
of the free end of each strip extended beyond
the rear beam. These having been put in place,
there was a hasty smoothing of all timbers with
sandpaper and another coat of shellac and
when Saturday night came, the big skeleton-like,
fragile-looking frame, which almost filled
the big boatshed, was locked up with the feeling
that the hardest work had been accomplished.</p>

<p>By Tuesday night, both planes had been covered.
The muslin, cut in full six-foot pieces,
had been soaked in Andy’s waterproof solution
(equal parts of alum and sugar of lead) and
dried. Then one end of a piece was glued to
the front edge of the beam and fastened with
copper tacks. Carefully the strip was drawn
back, and, as it was stretched skin tight, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
fast with small tacks to the ribs. The rear end
was turned under and glued to prevent raveling.</p>

<p>“This is worse than ribbin’ her,” panted
Andy more than once as he pulled at the muslin.
“And I reckon the bottom ain’t agoin’ to
be any easier.”</p>

<p>Nor was it. But when the work was done,
the result of a week’s labor began to look like
an aeroplane. The muslin was now treated to
a good coat of varnish, which turned the white
stretches to a golden brown color.</p>

<p>The next step was the bracing of the frame
with wires. Suitable metal plates, with hooks,
to be attached to the stanchions to afford points
for holding the wires, were not available.
Therefore, these were made out of sheet steel
by Andy and Captain Anderson in the shop
over on Goat Creek. Screw holes were bored
by the hand drill found there, and an edge of
each sheet was turned into a hook by heating
the metal in the forge and blue-tempering the
plate afterwards.</p>

<p>Progress seemed to be slower now, but the
interest in the work increased in proportion.
When all the open spaces between the stanchions
had been crossed with diagonal wires tied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
to the steel plates at the top and bottom of each
upright and the turn-buckles had been inserted
in the middle of each length of wire, the proud
artificers were ready to key the unstable frame
into rigidity.</p>

<p>This was a most delicate task. Truing the
long frame on the floor and squaring its vertical
parts with a level, the task was to tighten
the wires without warping the sections.</p>

<p>“It’s like tunin’ a piano,” laughed Andy.</p>

<p>“Or tightenin’ a sawbuck,” suggested the
captain.</p>

<p>Then Andy discovered that the tightened,
straining wires were acutely vibrant, and he
began to test his work by twanging the wires
with his fingers, like the strings of a harp.</p>

<p>“Here, you,” exclaimed the busy boat
builder, “you can’t work and play, too—”</p>

<p>“You can’t?” laughed Andy. “What are
you doin’?”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” snickered Captain
Anderson. “The whole thing is play to me.”</p>

<p>A part of nearly every evening of the ten
days already consumed in making the aeroplane
frame had been devoted to theories and sketches
and plans for attaching the bird-tail rudder, the
engine and propeller shafts, the wires to flex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the free extensions of the upper plane and, most
important of all, a universal lever to flex
the planes and operate the tail rudder
simultaneously.</p>

<p>Pieces and braces were now attached to the
frame to hold the engine and propellers similar
to those on the Wright machine. The seat for
the operator also followed the Wright plan.
The universal operating lever was an ingenious
adaptation of the Wright control.</p>

<p>“It looks good to me,” approved Andy, when
the resourceful captain suggested the contrivance.</p>

<p>“It’s about as flimsy as everything else,”
grunted Captain Anderson. “I’d hate to trust
my safety to this, or any other part of the
spidery thing—”</p>

<p>“Hush!” interrupted the boy, with a warning
finger. “Not a word o’ that kind where
mother can hear it. Now, when I get up in that
thing—”</p>

<p>“You?” broke in the captain, looking very
sober, as he did when much amused. “Who said
you were going up in it?”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” retorted the boy, “you know <em>you</em>
ain’t. And Ba ain’t—”</p>

<p>“Don’t fly your aeroplane till it’s built,”
teased the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The lever to operate the planes and bird-tail
rudder was at the right of the operator’s seat.
It was to be attached to the forward beam by
means of a rocking-hinge—also devised by Captain
Anderson, and later made by Andy—that
permitted a straight motion forward and back
and a movement to right and left at right angles
to the other motion.</p>

<p>About six inches above the beam, a wire was
made fast to the lever. This wire extended to
the right and left, and passed beneath grooved
wheels attached to the base of the first and second
stanchions to the right and left. From the
second wheel on each side the wire passed up
and diagonally to the rear and far corner of the
upper plane, where it was made fast. Throwing
the lever to the right drew down the rear of
the extended upper plane on the left, while the
contrary motion reversed the operation.</p>

<p>A frame of spruce and pine, extending ten
feet in the rear, passing between the orbits of
the propellers and braced with wires extending
to the ends of the car beams, was planned to
carry the proposed tail-guide. The shaft to
operate this was a reinforced length of spruce.</p>

<p>This rudder shaft extended to the universal
control lever. From this end of the shaft, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
quarter-inch round steel pin extended through
the lever and was secured by a nut so that the
shaft might revolve and yet be pushed backward
and forward by a front and rear movement
of the control rudder.</p>

<p>The mechanism to revolve the shaft to the
right or left at the same time was what taxed
Captain Anderson. In an attempt to secure this
result, he added a small hand lever to the top
of the principal control lever. This adjunct
was so hinged that it might be moved only to
the right and left, and had no play forward or
backward. At the base of this little lateral lever
a cross-arm was attached, about six inches
long. The movement of the little lever gave
this cross-arm a rocking motion up and down.</p>

<p>From each end of the rocking lever a hinged
arm extended downward and engaged—through
guides—a cogged wheel, also fastened on the
control shaft.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that’s exactly the way my uncle
meant it to work,” commented Andy enthusiastically.
“If you throw the control lever to the
right, the left rear plane is depressed. The
same motion turns the wheel on the lever shaft.
This, working in the cog on the rudder shaft,
gives it a reverse motion—and that throws the
fins of the tail on a diagonal slant to the right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m followin’ out your idea,” assented the
captain. “But I don’t know what it means.”</p>

<p>Andy laughed and explained it all again.</p>

<p>“Turning to the right with the usual rudder,
tends to make the machine dart in that direction,
just as a boat does when you turn quickly.
To stop that, a part of the aeroplane surface on
that side is drawn down—that increases the atmospheric
pressure and tends to right the machine;
the flexing wires see to that. But my
uncle’s bird-tail guide goes further: it attempts
to lessen this tendency to dart by flexing the
rudder on the side that isn’t doing the turning.
By elevating the idle corner, he decreases the
wind pressure, and that part of the machine
settles. See?”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” admitted the captain. “But
there’s the machinery to do what you want.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>DESPERATE NEEDS AND A BOLD APPEAL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Before the end of the coming week the aeroplane
would be finished. As this time approached,
Andy began to be greatly bothered.
At first, he had worried alone over the airship
and the possibility of being able to construct it.
Now, he was satisfied that a practicable air
craft would result.</p>

<p>“And what then?” Andy was debating this
on Sunday morning as he stood before the idle
boathouse. “What’s the good of it all? It’s
a cinch that my mother ain’t goin’ to let me try
to run it. And what if she does consent? For
a fellow who hasn’t had a particle of experience,
to bang away with a car like that’d be a
crime. Everyone has to learn. I can, I know,
but a fellow certainly don’t do it the first time.
It’s twenty chances to one that I’d break the
thing the first dash out of the box. Gee whiz!
but it does seem a shame.”</p>

<p>“What’s a shame?” asked Captain Anderson,
who was strolling to a seat on the pier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Andy explained, walking by his friend’s side.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you’ve begun that line o’ reasoning
pretty late,” commented the captain, as
he filled his morning pipe. “To tell the truth,
I haven’t bothered about it because I’ve
thought all along that your mother would first
object and then relent. And I supposed anyone
could operate an aeroplane who had the
nerve—”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” acknowledged Andy, “they
can’t. I’m not afraid, but a fellow ought to
begin with a gliding machine and learn how to
handle it—get used to dips, angles, and darts,
and what’s necessary to correct ’em. If he
don’t do that, he should, at least, go up several
times with someone who can tell him all about
it.”</p>

<p>The captain drew on his pipe slowly.</p>

<p>“Then what have we been breakin’ our backs
over?” he asked soberly. “All along we’ve
been makin’ something we haven’t any use
for.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you there,” answered
Andy positively. “It is of some use—we found
we could make it.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” exclaimed the captain. “I could
have told you that; I wouldn’t have begun her
if I hadn’t known that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re not sorry, are you?” asked the lad,
a little plaintively.</p>

<p>“Sorry!” laughed Captain Anderson. “Not
a bit, except for you. All I was doin’ was for
fun and because you were so eager.”</p>

<p>“I know,” answered Andy quickly, “and you
bet I’m grateful enough. I’m only gettin’ cold
feet now because you’ve made such a dandy.
If it was only my own work, a sort o’ patched
up thing with a common engine, I’d bang away
and take a chance in it, if I could. But I don’t
believe there has ever been a better flyin’ machine
made, and if I smashed her, I’d never
forgive myself. But it ain’t because I’m
afraid.”</p>

<p>“Then,” answered the old boat builder sympathetically,
“we’ll finish the job if we never
use the machine. It’ll be a nice piece of
work—”</p>

<p>“And maybe something’ll happen,” interrupted
the boy.</p>

<p>“There’s always a chance,” answered the
man, with a big smile. “But I can’t see what
can happen that’ll ever make it of use. Not
unless the clouds part some day and drop a
trained aviator at our feet—someone lookin’
for a job.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s it,” exclaimed the boy impulsively.
“Not out of the clouds, of course. But, perhaps,
maybe, someway, somehow such a man
might happen along.”</p>

<p>The captain smiled and began to unfold his
paper.</p>

<p>“Or,” went on Andy, “if he didn’t happen
along, we might <em>send</em> for one—”</p>

<p>“Send for one!” exclaimed the man. “You
mean hire an aviator to come down here into
the wilderness?”</p>

<p>“I guess I didn’t mean that,” said Andy in
confusion. “I don’t know what I meant.”</p>

<p>His companion saw tears of chagrin and disappointment
almost showing.</p>

<p>“Don’t you bother, Andy. We’ll finish the
airship in the best manner we can. I hardly
think we can employ a professional aviator, but
something may happen—something usually
happens when you’re young enough and eager
enough.”</p>

<p>“If mother lets me, I’ll do it anyway,” broke
out the boy.</p>

<p>“And smash our beautiful machine?”
laughed the captain.</p>

<p>Andy winced.</p>

<p>“Come,” went on the captain. “I always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
worry to-morrow. Run into the house, get
something to read, and forget aeroplanes to-day.
I think it’s gotten on your nerves a
little.”</p>

<p>But the day was too fine for reading, and, as
a good sailing breeze came up, Captain Anderson
soon followed Andy, with a proposal that
all, including Ba, should sail to Melbourne.</p>

<p>The plunge of the swift <i>Valkaria</i> through
the water and the savor of the semi-salt spray
were enough to revive all the lad’s old enthusiasm.
<a href="#i_frontis">He took the tiller at times</a>, helped with
the sheets, and, long before Melbourne was
reached, the joy of sailing had pushed the aeroplane
temporarily into the background.</p>

<p>While waiting in the parlor of the little hotel,
his elders busy with new acquaintances, Andy
stumbled upon something that set him thinking.
In a few minutes, with almost a gasp—as if
some idea was too much for him—he left the
house and curled up on a seat on the gallery.
His forehead was wrinkled. He had come to a
sudden and bold decision, and he was trying to
persuade himself that it was not ridiculous.</p>

<p>“Anything new botherin’ you, Andy?” asked
Captain Anderson, as he appeared to tell the
boy that dinner was ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothin’ that’s botherin’ me,” answered
Andy, in a rather confident tone, “but I’ve got
an idea. I reckon it’s so foolish that I ain’t
agoin’ to tell about it—yet.”</p>

<p>As the boy followed the man into the house,
he folded up a newspaper he had found on the
parlor table and put it into his pocket. After
dinner Andy secured from the landlady some
paper, an envelope, and a stamp. In the office,
he wrote a letter which, however, he did not
seal.</p>

<p>That done, he composed himself until there
was talk of starting home. There was no post-office
at Valkaria, and as Andy had an important
letter that he wanted to mail at the earliest
opportunity, he managed to get Captain Anderson
aside.</p>

<p>A little nervously he drew out the paper he
had in his pocket. It was an Indian River
region paper—the <cite>Daytona Daily Beacon</cite>. The
boy pointed to the main article on the front
page—an account of the annual automobile
speed contests to be held during the coming
week. Although these races, which take place
on Ormond’s famed ocean beach—hard and
smooth as cement—are known all over the
world, Captain Anderson had no great interest
in them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’d like to go?” he began, glancing at
the article indifferently.</p>

<p>Instead of replying, the boy, his nervousness
most apparent, ran his finger down the column,
through the program, to the end, where it
paused on a sub-head entitled: “Distinguished
Visitors Present.” The captain’s eyes followed
Andy’s shaking finger. Then he saw it
pointing to two names. These were:</p>

<p>“J. W. Atkinson, President American Aeroplane
Works, Newark, New Jersey. Mr. Roy
Osborne, ditto.”</p>

<p>“Friends of yours?” asked the captain, still
mystified.</p>

<p>“Never saw either,” exclaimed the boy.
“But I want you to read this.”</p>

<p>He drew out his newly-written letter, and,
fumbling it in his excitement, finally got the
sheet in Captain Anderson’s hands. It read:</p>

<p>When Captain Anderson finished reading the
letter, his face was a puzzle. He frowned, he
ran his hands through his heavy silvery hair,
and he laughed.</p>

<p>“Andy,” he said, as he reached this stage,
“you are certainly bound to get on in the world.
Now, who’d have thought of that? Of course,
he won’t come—”</p>

<p>“Why won’t he?” snapped the boy. “I
would, if I were in his place and got a letter like
that—”</p>

<p>“But he’s evidently at Daytona with his
boss—”</p>

<p>“That’s it. They aren’t there for fun.
They’re watching motors; they’re lookin’ for
ideas.”</p>

<p>“But what do you know about him?”</p>

<p>Then Andy told the story of Roy Osborne,
which is so well known in aviation circles, and
which was familiar to him through the book
written about the young aviator’s hazardous
and interesting experiences in the west under
the title of “The Aeroplane Express.”</p>

<p>“And you’re goin’ to send it?” commented
the captain.</p>

<p>“Right away!”</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed the man, laughing, “it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
certainly a nervy thing to do. But, good luck
to you.”</p>

<p>There was no poling the <i>Valkaria</i> that evening,
and the sail home was full of joy to all.
The next morning, work on the aeroplane was
resumed with new vigor. The braced car now
occupied so much of the shop that, each morning,
Captain Anderson and Andy carried it out
to the sandy river shore, where it rested all
day on “horses,” that the two workmen might
have the entire shop for their further work.</p>

<p>It had been vaguely planned that the starting
and landing wheels would be wooden and handmade.
But from the moment Captain Anderson
read the letter to Roy Osborne and confronted
the possibility of exhibiting his work
to a professional, he became additionally ambitious.
Early Monday morning, he telephoned
to Titusville for three old bicycle wheels with
mending kits and a pump.</p>

<p>“Everything is right but the wheels,” he explained.
“And if she don’t work, we can’t afford
to have it because we fell down on them.”</p>

<p>That day and the next, Andy worked on the
wheel mechanism and the brake, while Captain
Anderson was at last wholly occupied with the
bird-tail guide. The most delicate work was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
required for the “heart” of the contrivance, as
he called it, which was the thin tail pinions of
wood, each of which had to be worked out like
the blade of a propeller.</p>

<p>The week went by with no word from Roy
Osborne. At first Captain Anderson was inclined
to twit Andy about his letter. But when
he saw how seriously the boy viewed his own
presumption, the sympathetic boat builder
ceased his joking.</p>

<p>“He might have answered my letter, at
least,” Andy would say.</p>

<p>Each day Ba sailed to Melbourne for the
mail, and each time he came back with no communication
from Daytona.</p>

<p>“By Saturday she’ll be ready for the engine,
I think,” said Captain Anderson in mid-week.</p>

<p>“I reckon so,” replied Andy, rather ruefully.
“But there’s no use o’ puttin’ the engine in
her as long as we’ve got to tote her in and out
of the shop every day.”</p>

<p>“No,” exclaimed the captain, “we’ll go the
limit. When we get that shaft rigging in and
the chain drives and the propellers on, I want
to see the engine hooked up to ’em. I want
to see those wheels move, if we’ve got to tie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
her to the dock to keep her from flyin’ away.
And we’ll fit on the rudder and the front balance,
too, just to see what the whole thing looks
like.”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to make her let me do it,” broke
in Andy impulsively. “Mother won’t have the
heart to refuse me when she sees it all out there
ready to fly.”</p>

<p>The captain took a long puff at his pipe and
laughed.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” he said slowly, “she looks like
the real thing to me. If your mother’ll let you,
go the limit. If she won’t fly, bust her. I don’t
care.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>ROY OSBORNE REACHES VALKARIA</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Andy had fallen into the habit of strolling up
the sandy road each evening about the time for
the Lake Worth Express to go south. But not
once did he catch the sound of the warning
whistle or the grinding brakes. Even the Friday
night train went by without slackening
speed, and the boy was almost ready to abandon
hope that Roy Osborne might come to his
rescue.</p>

<p>“The automobile races were ended this afternoon,”
said Andy when he returned to the house
after a vain visit to the box-car depot Friday
evening. “If he don’t come to-morrow evening,
I’ll give up.”</p>

<p>Although neither Andy nor Captain Anderson
talked much about the new aeroplane this
evening, the machine being practically complete,
they could not resist making it the subject
of some comment.</p>

<p>“It don’t look very strong to me,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Mrs. Anderson. “Where do you hitch on the
wings?”</p>

<p>In explaining that the wings were the two
planes, Andy grew verbose and was soon expatiating,
for the first time, on the magnificent
possibilities of the apparatus.</p>

<p>“Then you let it up with a rope,” suggested
Mrs. Anderson, upon whom, to tell the truth, a
good part of Andy’s technical talk was wasted.</p>

<p>Both Andy and Captain Anderson laughed.</p>

<p>“I wish we could,” exclaimed the captain,
“but I’m afraid we’ll have to sail it without
a rope. It works just like a boat—but in the
air,” he explained.</p>

<p>“But who guides it?” persisted his wife.</p>

<p>“Who? Why, there must be an operator. I
supposed you knew that—”</p>

<p>“I knew that much about it,” interrupted
Mrs. Leighton, with a half patronizing smile.
“I’ve just been waiting for Andrew to offer to
do it.”</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence. The captain
puckered his lips, and Andy grew white about
the mouth. Someone had to say something.</p>

<p>“And what if I did?” said the boy, at last,
his fingers gripped and his breath partly suppressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have you been counting on doing this?”
asked his mother, sitting upright and leaning
toward the distressed boy.</p>

<p>“N—no,” stammered Andy. “But there is
no one else.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Leighton turned toward Captain
Anderson:</p>

<p>“Do you want him to do this, Captain?” she
asked, her voice indicating that this situation
had been long anticipated.</p>

<p>“No,” exclaimed the captain. “<em>I</em> don’t want
him to do it. Of course, it is more than
dangerous.”</p>

<p>“You know you said you’d find someone,”
continued Mrs. Leighton, who was visibly under
a strain.</p>

<p>“I haven’t found anyone yet,” replied the
captain, somewhat crestfallen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leighton was silent a few moments.</p>

<p>“Captain,” she said at last, “whenever, in
your judgment, Andrew can be of further use
to you in this experiment, he may do as you
wish. If you think he ought to attempt to operate
this aeroplane, I feel that I must defer to
your judgment—”</p>

<p>The captain was on his feet in an instant,
shaking his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“We should have thought of all this before
we began and saved all our trouble and expense,”
he exclaimed. “It’s too late to mend
that, but it isn’t too late to prevent the boy
breaking his neck. I don’t recommend that he
turn aviator—I don’t even believe I’ll consent
to it.”</p>

<p>Any hope that Andy had that his mother
might approve of his undertaking to operate
the car, was dead. The boy arose and left the
room. He choked back a sob and wiped away a
few tears that he could not suppress, and then
walked far out on the pier and sat in the moonlight
alone and sadder than he had ever been
in his life.</p>

<p>When he finally entered the boathouse to go
to bed, he found Captain Anderson already
asleep. The boy wondered if his friend and
co-worker did not feel something of the same
disappointment. In the morning Andy was
awakened by a noise in the shop, and he turned
over to find Captain Anderson opening the big
double doors.</p>

<p>“Turn out, youngster, and give me a hand.
I want to get the car out so I can fasten on the
rudder.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’re goin’ to take a photograph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of it,” said Andy, with a sad smile, “and then
knock her to pieces. It would make a fine rack
to dry clothes on—”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to test her out if it’s the last
thing I do alive,” said the captain in a determined
voice.</p>

<p>“You?” exclaimed Andy, rolling out of bed.
“You? Not if I can stop you, you won’t.
You’re sure to kill yourself.”</p>

<p>“What about you?” replied his companion.</p>

<p>“Oh, I—well, that’s different. I always
wanted to. And you’re doin’ it just because—because
you’re mad.”</p>

<p>“Never mind why I’m doing it,” went on
the captain. “You get dressed and get busy.”</p>

<p>Without daring to make further protests, the
boy complied. At the earliest moment, however,
he went into the house and almost immediately
Mrs. Anderson appeared with a skillet
in her hand. Rushing down the path to the
boathouse, she cried:</p>

<p>“Charles Anderson, you’ll do no such
thing.”</p>

<p>Her husband, already bolting on the bird-tail
rudder frame, looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me you think you’re
goin’ sailin’ off in the sky in that thing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“I haven’t told you anything of the sort,”
answered the captain somewhat meekly.</p>

<p>“Well, are you?”</p>

<p>“I—I—”</p>

<p>“You are not! That’s all there is to that.
It’s bad enough to come down here and live
half the year doing nothing and seeing nothing
while you fritter away your time building boats
you don’t want, and nobody wants, I guess.
But you mark what I say, I ain’t goin’ to go
mopin’ around in black the rest o’ my life pretending
you weren’t crazy when you committed
suicide. And if you don’t tell me this
minute you’ll stay down on the ground, I’ll
smash every stick in this fool killer.”</p>

<p>“I—I—” began the captain again.</p>

<p>As he hesitated, his irate wife sprang forward
with her skillet in the air. The fragile
varnished spruce stanchions were at her mercy.</p>

<p>“I promise,” capitulated her husband. “I
won’t try it.”</p>

<p>“Then you come right in to breakfast,” exclaimed
Mrs. Anderson. “And if you want my
advice, you’ll put a match to that whole contraption
and try to get back to your senses
again. You, too, Andrew,” she said hotly as
she passed the alarmed lad. “You’re both
clean crazy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite this domestic conflict, Captain
Anderson and Andy could not resist a surreptitious
glance now and again and a covert
smile. But Mrs. Anderson was in earnest, and
the old-time silence about the new aeroplane
was resumed at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>“Othello’s occupation’s gone,” said Captain
Anderson in a low voice as he and the boy left
the house.</p>

<p>“He <em>may</em> come to-night,” almost whispered
Andy, referring to Roy Osborne. “Hadn’t
we better go ahead?”</p>

<p>Captain Anderson nodded his head toward
the kitchen, where Mrs. Anderson could be
heard making far more than ordinary kitchen
clatter.</p>

<p>“Nothing to-day,” he said, with a smile.
“Mrs. Anderson is the easiest-going woman in
the world. But, when she breaks out as she
did to-day, I don’t want to cross her. We’ll
put the car back into the shop, and—well, we
might try a sail until the storm is over.”</p>

<p>“There’s someone out already,” remarked
the almost disconsolate boy, pointing toward
a speck of sail far down the river.</p>

<p>Captain Anderson looked and led the way
to the boathouse. Unbolting the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
rudder frame he had already attached, he and
Andy carried the light frame into the shop.</p>

<p>“Something like a pallbearer,” remarked
the captain. “Maybe our sail will cheer us
up.”</p>

<p>Before he left the shop, he took down his
binoculars, and had a squint up and down the
river.</p>

<p>“Looks like Lars Nilsen’s <i>Frieda</i> from St.
Sebastian,” commented the captain, indicating
the boat in sight.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the man and the boy had
rowed out to the anchored <i>Valkaria</i>, and were
hoisting the sail, when Captain Anderson
noticed that the boat in the river had come
about and was making for his pier.</p>

<p>“It is Nilsen,” said the captain, “and he’s
comin’ in. Hang on to the mooring till we see
what he wants.”</p>

<p>As the <i>Frieda</i> approached the pier, it could
be seen that, besides the man sailing the boat,
a young man was aboard. By his side, in the
stern, lay a traveling bag. The passenger had
a smooth but somewhat tanned face, and he
wore a stiff-brimmed light-colored soft hat
such as are common in the far west.</p>

<p>Captain Anderson sang out a greeting to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
skipper of the little craft and, the moment its
nose touched the pier, the young man, bag in
hand, sprang on the dock.</p>

<p>Andy’s heart thumped with a sudden
thought. He dropped the mooring line, and
the <i>Valkaria</i> drifted dockward.</p>

<p>“Is this Captain Anderson?” called the
young man.</p>

<p>As the captain replied, the stranger continued:</p>

<p>“Then this is Andy Leighton!”</p>

<p>“It is,” shouted Andy, “and you’re Roy
Osborne!”</p>

<p>“One guess did it,” exclaimed the youth.
“I’m a little late, but we had a great sail. I
got your letter—came down last night, but got
carried to St. Sebastian and stayed all night
with Mr. Nilsen—came up in the <i>Frieda</i>—dandy
boat—how’s the airship?”</p>

<p>“I hardly thought you’d come,” began
Andy, embarrassed.</p>

<p>“It was sort of accidental,” replied the new
arrival, as he shook hands all around. “I was
to go back to Newark yesterday, but when I
showed Mr. Atkinson your letter, he said I
might come. I’m to join him at Lake Worth
to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“To-morrow?” exclaimed Andy. “Do you
have to go so soon?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Atkinson thought it wouldn’t take
long. I didn’t just understand. How did you
ever happen to get an aeroplane down here?”</p>

<p>As the party started up the pier, Andy began
his explanation. Without going to the
house, the group went at once to the boat shed.
Within five minutes, Roy Osborne, his coat off
and his sleeves rolled up, was again the expert
aviator. Swiftly he went over the newly
wrought car, examined every detail of the bird-tail
rudder and then asked Andy to operate it.
Then he did the same thing himself.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?” asked Andy with
barely concealed anxiety.</p>

<p>“An adaptation of Renaud’s idea,” answered
the young professional.</p>

<p>“Renaud?” repeated Andy. “I don’t believe
my uncle ever heard of him or his idea.”</p>

<p>“Quite likely,” answered Osborne, “but it is
a most ingenious application of the Frenchman’s
theory. It has never before been applied,”
he went on.</p>

<p>“Will it work?” exclaimed Andy.</p>

<p>“Mechanically, it looks good to me. But
there is only one way to find whether it is a
practical improvement—try it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you?” urged Andy.</p>

<p>“Let me see the engine,” was the youthful
aviator’s answer.</p>

<p>Here was something Andy understood. Almost
before Roy Osborne reached the delicate
motor, Andy had primed it, set his ignition,
and, much to his relief, had the cylinders softly
singing with the unbroken purr of the perfect
engine.</p>

<p>The sight of the aeroplane had not moved the
new arrival. But at the sound of the engine,
he sprang forward, and then stood amazed.
The next instant, his hands, big and sinewy
for his age, were on the cylinders as if caressing
them. His eyes glistened. Then his
strong hands caught one end of the throbbing
mechanism and raised it partly from the floor.</p>

<p>“Have you got the patterns for that?” he
exclaimed quickly.</p>

<p>“There are none,” answered Andy. “My
uncle made it—he’s dead.”</p>

<p>Osborne stopped and started the engine.</p>

<p>“I’ll give $10,000 for it and the right to
make it,” he added, after another moment.</p>

<p>Andy gasped; even Captain Anderson’s
mouth dropped open.</p>

<p>“How—how about the new rudder,” Andy
managed to say, at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know about that, yet. But I do
know about this. Will you sell it?”</p>

<p>Andy was confused; he hesitated, with no
definite thought.</p>

<p>“Show Andy how to operate our aeroplane,
if it’ll go,” put in Captain Anderson, “and I
reckon we can trade.”</p>

<p>Osborne turned to the excited, trembling
Andy.</p>

<p>“Is it a go?” he asked with a smile.</p>

<p>“If you can make our aeroplane fly,” answered
Andy, his face almost white with joyous
emotion, “and’ll teach me how to do it, you
can have anything I’ve got.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>THE PELICAN MAKES ITS FIRST FLIGHT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Based on his hasty examination of the aeroplane,
young Osborne instantly suggested a few
improvements or reinforcements. As most of
the work yet to be done, such as the attachment
of the rudder, landing skis, and wheels, would
increase the car so much in size that it could
not be taken in and out of the shop, everything
was immediately moved out of doors.</p>

<p>Then, before actual labor began, Captain
Anderson suggested that they go into the house
for a few moments. Andy chuckled. He knew
that the captain wanted to acquaint his suspicious
wife with the turn in affairs—possibly
the captain was afraid that Mrs. Osborne might
make a real attack with her skillet.</p>

<p>Andy could not but envy the young aviator’s
natty figure and the professional look about
him. It was with considerable pride that he
presented Osborne to Mrs. Anderson and his
mother.</p>

<p>“Maybe you don’t know about him,” began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Andy while Roy protested and grew red in the
face, “but there isn’t anyone in America,
young or old, who knows any more about flyin’
machines than he does. There’s a book about
him, and he ain’t but—how old are you?” exclaimed
the boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t vote yet,” laughed Roy. “This
is certainly a beautiful place for a home, Mrs.
Anderson.”</p>

<p>“And that book tells how he figured out an
aeroplane express in the deserts of Utah and
found a lost tribe of Indians—”</p>

<p>“But I can’t see that anything I did was half
as remarkable as the making of a complete
aeroplane down here,” broke in Roy.</p>

<p>“I never saw a regular flying machine,” said
Mrs. Anderson, “but this one doesn’t look like
one to me. Do you think it is all right?”</p>

<p>“No aeroplane is absolutely all right,” answered
Roy smiling. “But this one out there
is correct so far as I understand aeroplanes.
Anyway, I’m going to test this one out, and I
don’t expect to kill myself doing it.”</p>

<p>“How far can you go in it?” asked Mrs.
Leighton.</p>

<p>“If it works all right, I could go easily from
here to Lake Worth, or back over the Everglades,
or even across to the Bahamas—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>“To the Bahamas?” broke in Andy.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” affirmed Roy. “I understand
they aren’t over eighty-five or ninety miles
away. But I shan’t do any of these things.
I’ll make a thorough test of the apparatus and
then show Andy how to operate it.”</p>

<p>“Andy!” exclaimed Mrs. Leighton in alarm.</p>

<p>“I promised to,” explained Roy, surprised.
“That is, if he wants to try it.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Leighton was shaking her head.</p>

<p>“That’s part of my business, you know. I’ve
taught a good many persons and have never
yet had an accident.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I want him to learn,” said
Mrs. Leighton slowly.</p>

<p>“Mother,” spoke up Andy, with energy,
“didn’t you say I could try to operate this car
when Captain Anderson asked you to let me
do it?”</p>

<p>“I—believe I did,” conceded that lady hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Well, Captain Anderson,” exclaimed
Andy stoutly, “don’t <em>you</em> want me to try it?”</p>

<p>“If Mr. Osborne tests it out and takes you
up and shows you how, I think it’ll be all
right.”</p>

<p>“There,” urged the boy facing his mother,
“are you going to keep your word?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s see what Mr. Osborne has to say
about it after he has tried it,” pleaded the
boy’s mother.</p>

<p>That was all the concession Andy wanted.</p>

<p>At three o’clock the <i>Pelican</i> was completed.</p>

<p>“You have to wait for the wind to go
down, don’t you?” asked Captain Anderson.
“That’ll be about five o’clock.”</p>

<p>Roy shook his head.</p>

<p>“Some do,” he said, “but with a perfectly-made
machine and a powerful engine, I like a
fair breeze.” He looked about. “I’m all
ready.”</p>

<p>The river shore at each side of Captain Anderson’s
place was crossed by a wire fence.
On the south side of the pier, the hard, white
sand stretched like a road for miles. Here
and there was a little driftwood. Captain
Anderson removed the fence with a few blows
of an axe, while Andy ran down the shore to
remove the driftwood.</p>

<p>“I suppose you think it strange I don’t
help,” said Roy to Mrs. Anderson and Mrs.
Leighton, who were on the pier. “But that’s
the first thing an aeroplane operator has to
learn. When I make an extensive flight, I do
no work that day if I can help it. My assistants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
fill the tanks and get the car in place. I
save every bit of muscle and nerve force I
have.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t stuck to your rule to-day,”
suggested Mrs. Leighton a little anxiously.
“You’ve worked harder than the others.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this isn’t a <em>real</em> flight,” explained
Roy. “I mean one in which you’re going to
do stunts in the way of an exhibition. I shan’t
go high or far. If I were going up several
thousand feet—”</p>

<p>“Several thousand feet!” exclaimed both
ladies.</p>

<p>“The safety in aeroplane work,” Roy explained,
“is in going very high or very low—no
middle ground. Either go so low that a
fall won’t hurt you, or get up so high that if
anything happens, your machine will have
time to get into a glide.”</p>

<p>The fence having been removed and the
beach cleared, the taut, bird-like aeroplane
was carefully trundled around the pier and
out on the sand facing south, from which direction
the breeze was blowing. Andy and the
captain were visibly nervous.</p>

<p>Then, as if it had just occurred to him, Roy
said he would test the engine once more. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Anderson and Mrs. Leighton had followed
close behind. Roy turned with a smile.</p>

<p>“You ladies had better step to one side,” he
suggested. “There’ll be quite a commotion
behind. Take hold of her,” he said to the captain
and Andy.</p>

<p>He located Captain Anderson and Andy at
the rear of the car on opposite sides of the
rudder frame and told them to sit on the
ground and dig heel holes in the sand as if
pulling on a rope in a tug-of-war.</p>

<p>“And pull your hats over your eyes,” he
ordered. “Hold your heads down and hang
on until you get the word to ‘let go’.”</p>

<p>The captain, not less eagerly than Andy,
did as directed, and Roy, having turned the
propeller blades into place, started the engine.
The first whirr of the big blades began
to agitate the loose sand and dry grass. Then
the young aviator turned on more power. The
agitation grew into a breeze, and that into a
tornado-like storm of wind. The boy and the
man on the ground felt the aeroplane pulling,
and as it began to tug at its human anchors
and rock from side to side, Roy quickly shut
off the engine.</p>

<p>“Fine,” he remarked without excitement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
as the dust and grass settled and Andy and
the captain shook the dirt from their faces.
“Nothing the matter with that engine.” Then
with another look about and a “feel” of the
hand for the wind, he walked to the front of
the car.</p>

<p>The breeze seemed a little stronger now. As
the young aviator noticed this, he ran into the
boathouse and appeared with his coat. This
he buttoned and then turned up the collar.</p>

<p>“There’s just a chance that I’ll have to go
up a little to turn and get back on the beach,”
he explained, “and you don’t have to go very
high to find it considerably cooler.”</p>

<p>Then he turned the visor of his cap to the
rear, and climbed into the seat.</p>

<p>“Hold on till you get the word,” he commanded.
At the same moment he started the
engine again.</p>

<p>Once more the rush of wind behind told the
power of the revolving propellers. Roy did
not look behind. One hand on the engine valve
and the other on the lever control, he sat unmoving.
Lower and lower dropped the heads
of the captain and Andy, as their heels sank
into the sand and their hands gripped the
framework—the fragile car was throbbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
with power and the propellers were no longer
visible.</p>

<p>“She’s slippin’—!”</p>

<p>“Let go!” shouted Roy.</p>

<p>As the captain and the boy fell backward,
the untested aeroplane darted forward. For a
few yards, it bounded up and down, and then,
as if gathering new force, shot straight over
the smooth sand.</p>

<p>Once it seemed about to rise, and then, striking
the beach again, the aviator seemed to lose
control of the machine. The rushing aeroplane
shot sideways, as if to dash into the
shallow river. Again it sprang upward, and
again darted toward the river. Just as the
forward wheel touched the water, the great
planes caught the breeze, poised themselves
for an instant, and rose in the air like a fluttering
duck. Twice its rear wheels touched
the surface of the river, and then the spectators
could see Roy shoot the bird-tail rudder
shaft to the rear and the pinions fly upwards.</p>

<p>“He’s off!” shouted Andy.</p>

<p>“You bet he is!” shouted Captain Anderson
just as vigorously. “She’s flyin’!”</p>

<p>On the sand, Andy raced back and forth, as
if he had lost his senses. With a loud whoop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
of joy, he turned a handspring as the only relief
for his bottled-up excitement.</p>

<p>Out over the river the <i>Pelican</i> flew a few
hundred feet, and then, veering toward the
beach, began to rise. Her propellers seemed
to sound louder as she lifted herself. And
southward, Roy held her, between two hundred
and three hundred feet above the beach,
for perhaps a half mile.</p>

<p>Then her operator began to mount higher.
As he did so, he turned out over the water and
brought the machine about toward the north,
at least eight hundred feet above the water.</p>

<p>Andy ran to his mother and threw his arm
around her.</p>

<p>“Watch it!” he cried. “Isn’t it a wonder?”</p>

<p>But his mother was too astounded to make
a reply.</p>

<p>Having tested the machine, Roy could not
resist one of his exhibition stunts. His propellers
going full speed, he headed the car toward
the beach at a point a little south of
where the fence had stood.</p>

<p>Coming directly toward his audience, his
speed could only be guessed by the rapidly
growing outlines of the car.</p>

<p>This was shooting downward like some swift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
bird in search of prey. At the angle at which
it was traveling, it must surely dash itself on
the beach.</p>

<p>“Look out!” yelled Andy, alarmed.</p>

<p>Then something happened. With coolness
that had come only with many flights, the boy
in the machine made two swift motions. As
one hand shut off the engine, the other shot
back the rudder lever. The darting machine
responded to the guiding planes, rose lightly
as if it had struck an atmospheric hill, and
then, the propellers coming to an instant stop,
the machine floated gracefully forward as if
on invisible tracks. Touching its wheels
daintily on the ground a few times, it came to
a gentle run which ended as Roy gradually
applied the wheel brake.</p>

<p>“She wants a little ballast on the right
side,” said Roy as he slid from his seat. Then
he reached out his hands to the captain and
Andy, and said, with a laugh:</p>

<p>“Any time you gentlemen need jobs, I’ll
undertake to get them for you in Newark.
Your machine is all right. The bird-tail guide
certainly helps. I found a little trouble to
start because I didn’t give it enough play; I
didn’t allow for the counter-action. But it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
certainly helps. Did you see the turn? With
a plain rudder, I’d have come almost to a
standstill doing that. I had a dip, but nothing
like the usual one.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we can get a patent on it?”
asked Andy almost perfunctorily, for he was
already feeling the engine cylinders and inspecting
the shafts for hot bearings.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Roy, loosening his
coat and reversing his cap. “The idea I’ve
heard of before—maybe it is patented. But
I’d try. And, if you can, I hope you’ll give
us the first chance at it—I mean our company.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you scared?” asked Mrs. Leighton.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Leighton,” answered Roy, “you
can’t make an aviator—he’s born. That is,
you can’t educate away fear. I am scared
sometimes, but it’s from the engine behind
my back, never because of the height at which
I’m working. But I wish they’d put an engine
where you could watch it. A hundred
feet up or three thousand, it’s all the same to
me. The engine is what I’m afraid of. But
here’s one I’m less afraid of than any I ever
saw.”</p>

<p>The short winter day was coming to an end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
but the sun was yet above the horizon. The
breeze had dropped a little. Andy turned
suddenly from his examination of the motor
and whispered to Roy. The latter smiled and
nodded his head.</p>

<p>“Mother,” said Andy, “Mr. Osborne won’t
be here long. I’m going up with him.”</p>

<p>“I—” began Mrs. Leighton. “Are you
sure it’s safe, Mr. Osborne?”</p>

<p>“We can never be sure of that,” answered
Roy. “But I’d rather trust myself in an
aeroplane than on a motorcycle.”</p>

<p>“What if your engine stopped?” suggested
the disturbed woman.</p>

<p>“It stopped just now. Or, I stopped it,”
added Roy. “I can’t go up without the engine,
but I can come down without it.”</p>

<p>“Well—” began Mrs. Leighton.</p>

<p>“Can you hold her alone, Captain Anderson?”
shouted Andy joyously, knowing that
consent had been given.</p>

<p>“I can hold her until she pulls away,” responded
the captain soberly, “and when she
does that, I guess she’ll be pullin’ some.”</p>

<p>“That’ll do,” said Roy. “Climb aboard.”</p>

<p>Three minutes later, Andy Leighton rose
from the ground in his first aeroplane flight—but
not the last by any means.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>BA, THE BAHAMAN, TALKS AT LAST</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“The first thing I discovered,” said Andy,
when his flight was over, “was that it isn’t
half as scary as it looks. When I’ve watched
aviators and seen the planes dip, it always
seemed I’d feel as if it was sure goin’ to turn
over. But you don’t.”</p>

<p>“It’s because you are moving with the machine,”
explained Roy. “A grade don’t seem
as steep when you are on it.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get up even a thrill,” declared
Andy. “I supposed I’d hang on—I didn’t.
Why, Roy even let me look after the engine.”</p>

<p>“When I began flying,” said Roy, “I went
up alone. It was a foolish thing to do. After
that, when I was really learning, I had to follow
Mr. Atkinson’s first rule for new men—if
they flew lower than six feet or higher than
twenty-five, he made them descend. Follow
that rule, and you’ll learn all you can find out
by going up higher.”</p>

<p>It was agreed that nothing more should be
done that day. The aeroplane was wheeled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
over near the boathouse and the engine was
covered with a tarpaulin. There would be no
risk in leaving it thus exposed, but Captain
Anderson said Ba would likely show up, as it
was Saturday night. The colored man was to
act as watchman.</p>

<p>“And how long are you going to keep that
up?” asked the thoughtful Mrs. Anderson.
“What use is the thing going to be?”</p>

<p>This was a poser. The captain did not attempt
an answer.</p>

<p>“I’d like a few more lessons, if I can get
them,” suggested Andy.</p>

<p>“You can operate it now,” put in Roy, “if
you do as I said.”</p>

<p>“Why do you want more lessons?” asked
Mrs. Leighton in turn. “Are you thinking of
becoming an aviator yourself?”</p>

<p>Roy smiled, and Andy’s jaws set. But the
boy made no reply.</p>

<p>When Roy, the aeroplane cared for and the
exciting flights having been discussed in all details,
suggested that he might as well board
the night train and proceed to Lake Worth,
there was a protest on the part of all. The
young aviator had already endeared himself
to his Valkaria hosts. Finally, he was persuaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to stay over Sunday, with the promise
of a sail on the <i>Valkaria</i> the next day.</p>

<p>Nearly all of Sunday was spent on the <i>Valkaria</i>.
Saturday night and Sunday night,
Roy and Andy slept in the boatshed, the captain
returning to the house.</p>

<p>By the time the two boys went to sleep Sunday
night they had become fast friends. It
was arranged that the model of the bird-tail
propeller was to be sent to Andy’s father in
St. Paul that he might consult a patent lawyer
concerning it. The boys were not so clear
about the engine.</p>

<p>Roy had really no power to buy it outright
for Mr. Atkinson before consulting that gentlemen.
But he told Andy that he felt sure
his employer would be eager to get the motor.
Mr. Atkinson, he felt sure, would send his
motor superintendent down to look at the
engine, and Andy, in turn, assumed the power
to give Roy and his friends an option on the
engine, subject to examination. Andy was
careful to secure Captain Anderson’s approval
of these negotiations.</p>

<p>“Have it your own way,” Captain Anderson
said. “I reckon your father and I can
settle it between us when I see him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Four times on Monday did the <i>Pelican</i> make
successful ascents. On the last one, at two
o’clock, Andy made his first flight alone. So
far as his anxious observers could see, his
operation of the car was in no way different
from that of young Osborne. At least, the
moment Andy alighted, Roy slapped him on
the back and said:</p>

<p>“I guess I’m not needed longer. You can
teach someone else now.”</p>

<p>And, despite the regrets of his new friends,
the young aviator boarded the night train for
Lake Worth, each boy agreeing to write to the
other, and Roy promising to send his latest
pupil an aneroid barometer and an anemometer
as soon as he reached Newark.</p>

<p>That night, as on the two previous nights,
the strange Ba watched the new aeroplane.
The next morning Captain Anderson suggested
that the rudder, landing skis, and engine
be detached and the frame and parts
housed in the shop until the possible arrival of
the motor expert from the north.</p>

<p>Andy entered a protest at once.</p>

<p>“I should say not,” he said; “that is, unless
you insist. I want to make a real flight.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I want to take it apart,” confessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the captain frankly. “I knew you’d
want to keep it up.”</p>

<p>“You’re not afraid of my breaking it, are
you?” queried the boy.</p>

<p>“I’m only afraid of your breaking your
neck.”</p>

<p>“Were you afraid Osborne would break his
neck?”</p>

<p>“That’s different—he’s an expert.”</p>

<p>“‘Expert’,” repeated Andy. “I’ll be an
expert when I’ve had the practice. And how
will I get it? Not by readin’ about airships.”</p>

<p>“Settle it with your mother,” exclaimed the
captain. “I certainly won’t object, if she
don’t.”</p>

<p>Although Andy’s head was now brimming
full of his great, but sleeping, project, he was
not yet ready to consult his mother about it.
As another step in his great plan, however, he
obtained permission to go to his uncle’s house,
one of the conditions being that he was to
bring back some fruit. Although Ba had been
watchman for three nights, none knew when
he slept. And as soon as Andy got out the
<i>Red Bird’s</i> oars, the negro made ready to
accompany him.</p>

<p>Andy’s mind was on other things, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
never neglected an opportunity to talk to the
Bahaman. Usually he approached the subject
diplomatically. That morning on the way to
Goat Creek, he was out of sorts. Therefore,
and much to his own surprise, he blurted out:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you tell me about that Timbado
place, Ba? What are you afraid of?”</p>

<p>For a moment the colored man gave no sign
in face or gesture that he heard. Then, as in
the past, his lips began to twitch and his narrow
brow grew narrower.</p>

<p>“You ain’t go on dat Timbado?” he repeated,
his usual slow-witted question.</p>

<p>“Sure I am,” answered Andy perversely.
“Why not? I’m thinkin’ of goin’ right over
there.”</p>

<p>There was no outward change in the black
man’s bearing, but the boy could see that some
emotion was affecting him within. They had
reached Goat Creek, and, as the little boat
passed into the currentless channel, Ba ceased
rowing.</p>

<p>“Marse Andy,” he began in a husky voice,
“Ah done bin on dat Timbado—white men
don’ go dar.”</p>

<p>“<em>I’m</em> thinkin’ of goin’,” exclaimed Andy,
hoping to draw out the colored man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Ba looked at him long and intently.</p>

<p>“Yo’ ain’t know de big white man in Andros—Cap’n
Bassett?”</p>

<p>Andy knew that Andros was one of the Bahama
“out islands” and that more than one
white man lived there, plantation owners.</p>

<p>“An Englishman?” asked the boy.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Bassett done took me on de boat
when Ah bruk out de jail in Nassau.”</p>

<p>“And took you to Timbado?” asked Andy
eagerly, overjoyed to find at last some inkling
of Ba’s story.</p>

<p>The colored man shook his head.</p>

<p>“Two crops Ah wuk on Andros. Den dey
sunt me to it.”</p>

<p>“Captain Bassett sent you to Timbado?”</p>

<p>A gulp came in the colored man’s throat and
he simply nodded his head.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Wid Nickolas an’ Thomas—dey ain’t
never git away.”</p>

<p>“Ba,” exclaimed Andy sharply, “why did
you go to Timbado?”</p>

<p>“Yo’ ain’t nebber hear ’bout Timbado?”</p>

<p>“I never heard of Timbado—”</p>

<p>“Cap’n Bassett tole us to steal it.”</p>

<p>“Steal what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yo’ ain’t nebber hear ’bout dat big pearl?”</p>

<p>“You mean that Captain Bassett sent you
and two other men to steal a big pearl?” asked
Andy breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Ah done see it, but Nickolas and Thomas
dey don’ see it.”</p>

<p>“Saw a big pearl?”</p>

<p>“Like dat,” said Ba suddenly, leaning forward
and holding out his heavy thumb. “An’
like de conch look.”</p>

<p>“A pink pearl as big as your thumb?” questioned
Andy, his voice dropping into a whisper.</p>

<p>“Dat’s fetich,” was the frightened answer.
“Ain’t no white man see dat big pearl.”</p>

<p>“And you stole it for Captain Bassett?”
went on the boy excitedly.</p>

<p>The frightened Bahaman shook his head
again.</p>

<p>“What happened?” persisted his companion.
“Tell me!”</p>

<p>“Ah ain’t nebber see dat Nickolas. Ah
ain’t nebber see dat Thomas no mo’.”</p>

<p>“And you?” insisted Andy. “Did you get
the pearl?”</p>

<p>The oarsman’s hands were trembling. It
was evident that in his half-savage way, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
was trying to recall what happened or to think
of words to describe it. Again he shook his
head, and then suddenly drew the oars into
the boat and shipped them. His mouth twitching
and his eyelids trembling, he caught his
loose shirt with both hands and drew it up to
his shoulders. At the same time, he turned on
the seat.</p>

<p>His great, muscle-knotted back was seamed
with a mass of scars. Long and deep wounds
that had turned white in the healing crossed
his flesh from his neck to his waist.</p>

<p>Andy shrank back. The persistency with
which he had forced the African into this revelation
covered him with shame.</p>

<p>“Yo’ ain’t goin’ on dat Timbado Key, is
yo’?”</p>

<p>It was Ba’s last appeal.</p>

<p>For answer, Andy could only touch the agitated
man sympathetically on his knee and
turn away. It seemed to satisfy the colored
man, and from that moment, ashamed of his
idle curiosity, Andy said no more.</p>

<p>But as he watched the stolid face of the
black Hercules, his imagination carried him
far from Goat Creek. The ignorant negro became
the center of a wild romance. What did it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
mean? A fugitive from justice carried away
from Nassau by an Englishman; kept in his
service for a time and then sent with two others
to steal a big pink pearl; two of the men disappear,
one of them sees the fetich jewel big as
a man’s thumb and pink “like a conch,” a
priceless treasure; then the cruel wounds that
must have meant death to any but a man like
Ba.</p>

<p>Little wonder that Andy had small thought
for anything else that morning. Landing at
his uncle’s place, he sent Ba to the grove for
the fruit, then sat a long time trying to compose
himself. Try as he might, to put the
weird tale out of his mind, he could not. Finally
he entered the house and feverishly
sought through the bookshelves until he found
an atlas.</p>

<p>After a long search he closed the book with
a sigh of relief. He could not find Timbado
Key.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it,” he admitted to himself.
“It may be only a crazy tale of Ba’s, but I’ve
had enough. Back to the aeroplane for me.”</p>

<p>The real thing that had brought Andy to his
uncle’s place that day was to examine a gasoline
barrel which stood behind the shop. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
oil used in all their flights so far had been secured
in Melbourne, Captain Anderson having
ordered it by telephone before consulting
the boy.</p>

<p>Andy was overjoyed to find the barrel at
least half full. There were no vessels suitable
for carrying any of it back, but there were
wood-encased tins at Captain Anderson’s, and,
satisfied with his discovery, the boy made
ready to depart. Before he did so, he made a
careful and significant examination of the open
space on the gentle incline in front of the
house, nodded his head approvingly, and,
locking the house again, entered the boat.</p>

<p>On the way home the boy was moodily silent,
a strange caprice for him. But he had suddenly
reached a point where he was disturbed
by doubts. He had been in Florida two weeks,
but seemed to have lived months in his unexpected
and sudden experience, and he was now
debating whether it was to end as suddenly in
nothing but a boyish fancy or to be the turning
point in his young life.</p>

<p>He was positive that never again might such
a glorious opportunity present itself to him to
make a name for himself. His few days with
Roy Osborne had fired him with an ambition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to achieve something out of the ordinary. The
question was—should he give his parents the
opportunity to crush his ambitions (and he
knew he would never disobey their instructions),
or should he win their later approval
by carrying out his secret plan without their
knowledge?</p>

<p>With scarcely a word to Ba, Andy lay in
the stern of the boat and thought. But the
more he thought, the further away seemed the
solution of his problem. Still lost in doubt,
the <i>Red Bird</i> touched Captain Anderson’s
pier.</p>

<p>“Cap’n Anderson’s gone off in the de <i>Valkar’</i>,”
said Ba.</p>

<p>It was true. Hastening to the house, Andy
found it deserted. The boathouse was closed.
On the door of the bungalow was a scrap of
paper. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Your father is at Melbourne. Telephoned
us. We’ve gone for him. Dinner in the pantry.
Back this evening.</i></p>

<p class="right">“<i>Anderson.</i>”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>ANDY TAKES A DARING CHANCE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Andy read the note, re-read it, walked to the
edge of the gallery and looked up and down
the wide river. His face was pale. Then he
consulted his watch. It was fifteen minutes
after twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>“Ah reckon dey all gib yo’ de go by,” said
Ba, with a laugh.</p>

<p>Instead of replying, Andy turned and entered
the house. On the kitchen table was his
luncheon. Evidently this was not in the boy’s
mind at that moment. In the living room, he
went to the chart-rack and took down the map
of the Bahama Islands.</p>

<p>Spreading it out on the table, he weighted
the ends, and sat for a few moments, his eyes
fixed upon it and his chin in his hands. Then
with a pencil and a bit of cardboard for a
ruler, he drew lines at right angles through
the mouth of Goat Creek and the westernmost
end of the Grand Bahama Banks. Following
the horizontal lines to the nearest degrees
marked on the chart, he had the latitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
each point. The same operation with the vertical
lines gave him the longitude.</p>

<p>These degrees, minutes, and seconds, he
wrote down in his memorandum book in this
form:</p>

<p>The subtraction showed him the difference
between the two points in degrees of latitude
and longitude. Andy had no tables to show
him the exact number of geographic miles in
a degree of latitude or longitude in that part
of the world. But, with the knowledge that a
degree of either was practically seventy miles
at the equator, he computed the number at
fifty miles.</p>

<p>The boy was fresh enough in his mathematics
to know that the hypotenuse of a rectangle
eighty-six miles by sixty-one miles would be
approximately—not allowing for the curvature
of the earth—one hundred miles. And
this he set down as the distance between Captain
Anderson’s dock and the nearest Bahama
land.</p>

<p>There was no time wasted in speculation on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
this point. Andy had evidently come to a decision,
and he was working directly to a specific
end. With the chart yet before him, he
went to the mantel, where, close beside the
captain’s binoculars, always rested a small
compass. Squaring the chart sheet with the
north and south line of the compass, Andy
laid the compass directly over the mouth of
Goat Creek. Then he extended his bit of cardboard
from the center of the compass to the
tip of the Bahama Bank.</p>

<p>The edge of the card cut the compass along
the S.E. by S. line. That was a course. With
another note of this under his latitude and
longitude, the boy sprang up, folded the chart
into a square to fit his pocket, dropped the
compass into another pocket, and smiled nervously.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’d better eat something,” he
said.</p>

<p>Returning to the kitchen, he partook of a
slice of cold ham, some bread and butter, and
a big drink of water. As he started to leave,
he again paused with the same nervous smile.
This time he took half an apple pie, the remainder
of the ham, a few slices of bread, and
filled a glass fruit jar with water. Passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
through the house again, he stopped at his
trunk and secured a light-weight sweater and
a pair of gloves. Then he passed out onto the
gallery, and on the bottom of the paper still
hanging on the door, he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Captain Anderson: Excuse my taking
your map and compass and pie and ham. To
my mother: I’m off on a trip in the aeroplane.
Don’t worry. I’ll be back to-morrow or send
word soon. Good-bye.</i></p>

<p class="right">“<i>Andy.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>A few minutes later the boy had the tarpaulin
off the engine. There was a close examination
of the motor, oil cups were newly
filled, and a can of lubricator was tied to one
of the stanchions. An empty gasoline tank
was made fast in the passenger seat, and in a
light basket attached to a second stanchion,
the busy lad deposited his sweater, water bottle,
luncheon, a hatchet, a box of matches, a
small hank of seine cord, some screws, wire,
and a screw-driver. Then he lashed to the
middle-section lower struts a bundle of spruce
strips suitable for repairing the frame of the
car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yo’ gwine fly away?” asked Ba, when
Andy’s preparations finally suggested this to
the dull-witted black.</p>

<p>“See this, Ba?” answered the boy, touching
the empty gasoline tin. “I’m goin’ up to my
uncle’s place to fill this tank.”</p>

<p>This was true, but only in part. The moment
Andy had found his mother and his hosts
absent, he had instantly conceived the idea of
making a flight to the shop on the hill to secure
more gasoline. When his face whitened out
on the gallery, this idea had given birth to another
one—he would do this, and if all seemed
well, he would steel himself to take the great
chance of his life. If ever, this was the time
to tempt fate with his big idea. It might even
mean death, but Andy put that possibility
aside. He saw only the opportunity to win
fame and reputation; to become a Roy Osborne
or a Walter Brookins.</p>

<p>With the help of the colored man, Andy got
the aeroplane out on the sand beach and
persuaded his assistant to become his human
anchor. At his uncle’s house he would have a
hill on which to pick up his momentum. The
boy looked at his watch—it was three minutes
after one o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>There was another delay while the vigilant
would-be aviator made further preparations.
With a cord, he tied his watch, facing him, on
the nearest stanchion, and with four long
screws made a little pocket on the lower beam
of the car beneath his legs, in which he deposited
his compass.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Ba,” he exclaimed, these details
completed, as he held out his hand.</p>

<p>The colored man touched his forehead in salute,
and then clumsily gave the boy his powerful
hand.</p>

<p>“Yo’ gwine come right back?” he asked.</p>

<p>But the boy did not reply. He was already
starting the engine, and Ba fell to his task of
holding the car. There was neither a break
nor miss in the engine, and as the dust settled
over the grim-set negro, Andy crawled into
his seat.</p>

<p>“Hold her!” he exclaimed sharply, and
once more the engine sprang into action.
Faster and faster it flew, but the trembling,
tugging car was safe in Ba’s powerful grip.</p>

<p>“All right!” shouted Andy at last, and
while Ba fell back, the <i>Pelican</i> was cluttering
over the beach with the quick roll of a sand
snipe. Then she took the air. Andy did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
wait for altitude. As soon as he felt that the
rushing air had his car on its breast, he began
his turn, mounting as he did so.</p>

<p>It was but a moment or so until the aeroplane
swept over the pier, having turned and
headed north. As it approached the boat landing
on which Ba had taken up his anxious
watch, the boy dropped the car until it was
not over fifty feet above the river.</p>

<p>“Wait here, Ba, I’ll be back in a few
minutes.”</p>

<p>The ease with which the car worked elated
Andy. That he might not become over confident
and to see if everything was all right, he
began to mount again at once. He seemed to
fall into the trick naturally. Before Goat
Creek was reached, he was nearly a thousand
feet above the river. Then, taking the turn
and dip like a veteran, and without the slightest
fear, Andy headed the aerial craft for the
house on the hill.</p>

<p>The landing was made a little abruptly, but
nothing was broken. Pushing the machine to
the top of the hill, the boy turned it, and,
throwing off his coat, began the work of refilling
his engine gasoline tank and getting the
extra can aboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he entered the house, wrote a note,
which he addressed to his mother, locked the
place and put the key in the envelope with his
note. This time he buttoned up his coat and
reversed his cap as Roy Osborne had done, for,
from the time he made this ascension, he would
have neither time nor opportunity to do anything
but direct his car at untried heights,
over unknown land and sea to fame and glory.
He did not stop to think of anything else.</p>

<p>From the time his engine started and the
big propellers began to revolve, he was sorry
that he had not brought Ba along to hold the
car until it had begun to feel the pressure of
the air. With nearly the first motion of the
propellers, the aeroplane began to move forward
and slowly descend the hill. The new
angle seemed to prevent the planes from catching
the air, and, as the frame gathered momentum
and continued to rumble along over
the dry grass, Andy pushed his engine in vain.</p>

<p>The wheels seemed as if running on a track.
Like a flash, an idea came to the alarmed operator,
and as he shut off the engine, Andy put
on the wheel brake. Just at the base of the hill
and in front of the hummock swamp, the <i>Pelican</i>
was brought to a stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Escape number one,” said Andy, “and my
own experience number one.”</p>

<p>Then, laboriously and slowly, he managed
to get the wide, balanced frame up the slope
again and to the top of the hill.</p>

<p>“I’m in fine shape now,” thought Andy,
the perspiration oozing from him and his muscles
all a tremble, “but there ain’t any choice.”</p>

<p>He delayed only long enough to get a drink,
to wipe his face, and readjust his coat, then
once again he mounted his seat. This time his
first act was to put on the wheel brake. Then
he opened his engine and, to his relief, found
the car holding while the propellers got into
action.</p>

<p>When at last the powerful propelling screws
began to tilt the car forward and the rear
bird-tail guide began to lift itself from the
ground, the alert aviator released the brake,
and once again the fragile frame started down
the hill. But this time he could feel it jumping
at once, and when he gave it the upward
rudder, the hurtling craft immediately responded.
Like a soaring bird, it took the air
and was off.</p>

<p>It was but a few moments until the Anderson
bungalow was in sight, and Andy headed directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
for it. Dropping a little, he got out his
envelope containing the message to his mother
and placed it between his knees. He did not
attempt to call to the colored man, but when
he was nearly over the still waiting and apparently
transfixed Ba, the boy opened his knees
and the envelope fluttered down.</p>

<p>The paper fell in the water, but the colored
man rescued it and then stood for a long time
gazing at the aeroplane growing smaller in the
distance. Hours before Captain Anderson’s
<i>Valkaria</i> reached the pier that evening, the
<i>Pelican</i> was out of sight. And the last that
the vigilant negro saw of it was as it faded
into the southeast sky.</p>

<p>Even the stupid Ba knew that the message
he had in his shirt would mean a wild commotion
among the passengers who alighted from
the <i>Valkaria</i>. For a time he held aloof, waiting
to speak to Captain Anderson alone. It
was wholly dark when Mr. and Mrs. Leighton
and Captain and Mrs. Anderson reached the
house.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the two men rushed
from the cottage, while two women followed
behind with wild exclamations. Ba thrust his
message into Captain Anderson’s hands and
disappeared in the night. Andy’s note read:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Bulletin No. 1. Took more gasoline at
Leighton’s shop at eight minutes after one.
Weather fair, with light southwest wind.
Started for Grand Bahama Banks on </i>Pelican<i>
at 1:12 P.M. Hope to reach Nassau, New
Providence, to-morrow after stop on Grande
Banks. Will report by wire on reaching destination.
Am well and confident. Love to all.</i></p>

<p class="right">“<i>Andy.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>If the foolhardy boy could have witnessed
the scene that followed in the Anderson home,
he would have abandoned his aviation ideas on
the spot. In an hour the philosophy and arguments
of Mr. Leighton and Captain Anderson
began to calm Andy’s mother in a degree,
and then those concerned proceeded to make
what plans they could to accomplish, if possible,
the boy’s rescue, for it seemed to be
conceded that even then he must be verging on
destruction, if indeed he were not already lost.</p>

<p>At Captain Anderson’s suggestion, Lake
Worth was immediately called by telephone,
and the Nassau Steamer Company was asked
to notify its steamers in transit by wireless of
Andy’s flight. He would probably be north of
their course, but they were asked to keep a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
lookout. They were also asked to repeat the
message to Nassau, that spongers and fish
boats leaving port might also be on the watch.</p>

<p>“He may change his mind,” argued the
captain, “and make a landing far down the
peninsula, without putting out to sea. If he
does, he will be in a wilderness.”</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Leighton were so agitated that
they could not even protest when the captain,
a little later, determined to set out in the <i>Valkaria</i>
at once and proceed down the river. It
was one hundred and thirty miles, at least,
from the captain’s home to Lake Worth.
There were little settlements here and there
on the mainland side of the river and a wilderness
for the entire distance on the peninsula
side, where a strip of palmetto scrub and sand
separated the sea from the river.</p>

<p>The captain’s plan was to sail at once, secure
a couple of men at each settlement, carry
them across the river, and start them north
and south along the ocean in search of a possible
wreck of the <i>Pelican</i>. At the next town
this would be repeated. By the following
evening he hoped to cover a good part of the
wild country in this manner.</p>

<p>Beyond this, there was nothing that could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
be done. In the house of desolation Andy’s
parents waited sorrowfully for some word.
At nine o’clock the captain had sailed, Ba, as
usual, showing up in time to join him.
Through the night there was no news. Captain
Anderson reported about nine o’clock the
next morning from far down the river. There
was no sign of wreck or trace of the missing
boy.</p>

<p>The steamer arrived that day at Lake
Worth with a report of nothing seen. Wednesday
and Thursday went by with no word.
Thursday morning Captain Anderson returned
up river by train, Ba bringing the boat
later. Thursday evening at six o’clock came
a telephone call from Melbourne—a cable message
from New York. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Andros Island, via Nassau, New Providence,
by boat. Safe. Record Grande Banks.
Here noon to-day. O.K. Leave few days
steamer. Andy.</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>The enigmatic message was hard to read, but
the last word was enough.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” sobbed Mrs. Leighton, “he’s
coming back by boat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>But the next boat and the next arrived at
Lake Worth from Nassau without Andy, and
then in desperation his parents took farewell
of Captain and Mrs. Anderson and journeyed
to that resort to await their son.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>TIMBADO KEY AND CAPTAIN MONCKTON BASSETT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>From the moment Andy dropped his message
to Ba, he had no time for thought of those
he had left behind. For three or four miles
he shot straight down the river at a height of
about four hundred feet. In that time his first
nervousness lessened. He made ready to begin
his flight over the water.</p>

<p>The compass course he had laid was almost
S.E. by S. His first alarming discovery was
that his compass would be of almost no use.
The vibration of the frame and the constant
alteration of his level in ascending and descending
so agitated the needle that it was always
in motion.</p>

<p>“That ain’t goin’ to stop me,” he said at
once. “There’s land everywhere over there
to the southeast. I’ll hit something somewhere
sometime.”</p>

<p>Laying a general course by the sun, he veered
to the southeast. The moment he passed out
over the ocean, the air changed. The movement
of it was less regular, and Andy knew it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
was due to the counter-current of cooler water
sent southward by the northward-flowing gulf
stream. Steadying the car, he began to ascend.
At a thousand feet, the lower eddies
disappeared, and he felt the steady southwest
breeze reasserting itself.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of this, as a ship tacks,
he steadied the car again. Up to that moment
every second had been one of activity; both
hands had been busy, and every sense was
alert. As the aeroplane now fell into a long,
almost motionless glide—with nothing to mark
its progress but the whistling wind—for the
water beneath gave him no measure of flight—the
boy discovered that his muscles were
already partly numb from the strain.</p>

<p>As best he could, he relaxed his tension—exercised
his feet, legs, fingers, and arms.
But the attempt to relax his arms brought his
second big discovery—when soaring on an
even keel at high speed, the slightest movement
of the rudder may instantly cost many
minutes of hard climbing upward.</p>

<p>Attempting to steady the control lever with
his left hand, there was a slight pull to the left
and back. As the responsive ship answered
her double helm and veered to the left and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
down, Andy thrust the lever back, changed
hands, and his benumbed fingers for a moment
refused to act.</p>

<p>Shaking itself, under the conflicting movements,
the <i>Pelican</i> wavered and then leaped
to the right and down. Aghast, the nervous
boy saw the sea—the shore already out of
sight—apparently rising to meet and grasp
him. Paralyzed for a moment, Andy gave instant
proof that he was a born aviator.</p>

<p>Withdrawing his eyes from the sea and
bringing all his will power to stamp out his
sudden panic, he did two things with hardly
the operation of thinking. Setting his teeth
and forcing his eyes on the stanchion at his
side to get his line, with both hands—and as
carefully as if he had minutes for the work—he
brought the control lever to a vertical position,
and at right angles with the beam to
which it was attached.</p>

<p>His intuition told him he could do no more.
And it was enough. With a long, gliding,
downward sweep the car sped on and at last
began to move forward on an even keel. His
eyes yet fixed on the lever only, he gradually
drew it vertically toward him, and, when the
check in the forward speed told him he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
ascending again, looked below. He was not
over three hundred feet from the almost waveless
sea, and he had dashed downward seven
hundred feet.</p>

<p>“I understand now what they mean when
they kick about long flights,” said the boy to
himself. “It ain’t the nerves—it’s the muscles.
You’ve just kind o’ got to hold this
thing on its course—anyway she ain’t goin’
to run herself.”</p>

<p>When he figured himself to be about a thousand
feet in the air, once more Andy looked
at his watch. It was 1:30 o’clock. He had
been gone twenty-two minutes. He almost
groaned. Osborne had estimated the maximum
speed of the <i>Pelican</i> at forty-two miles
an hour. He was surely going at his best; he
was already tired, and since he had not covered
quite fifteen miles, he had the hardest
part of his voyage before him.</p>

<p>Since there was no relief, he must stand it,
and he did. He now kept the aeroplane at the
thousand-foot level, as nearly as he could estimate
it. The engine never wavered, and finally
he was able to ignore it. The boy’s eyes
grew hot and began to pain him, and he was
no longer conscious of power to move his right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
hand, when—and the slowly-creeping minutes
seemed endless—at 2:51 o’clock he caught sight
of a thin white line on the horizon.</p>

<p>The boy knew at once that this must be land.
Whether or not it was the land he had started
for—the Grande Banks—made no difference.
Confidence returned with the knowledge that
he had a goal to aim for, and in that assurance
he took his first moments to reason. He had
done a foolhardy thing, and now he meant to
bring his perilous flight to an end as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>What the place might be he neither knew
nor cared; his wind-swept eyes burning and his
spent muscles rigid, he was conscious only of
the line of white. As it rose and widened, he
hardly knew how or when he altered the course
of the plane. But at last, with an effort that
he was fearful he could not make—when the
white rolled out beneath him—he shut off the
engine. At 3:35 P.M., the rubber landing
wheels were bounding over the glaring white
of a shell-strewn beach.</p>

<p>The exhausted boy still sat in his seat, motionless,
his head on his breast and his fingers
yet grasping the idle lever. He had carried
out his great idea, reached the Bahamas in an
aeroplane, but with nothing to spare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Until Andy was able to get the numbness
out of his limbs, he gave no thought to his surroundings.
At last, creeping stiffly from the
machine, he found that he had achieved his
ambition: the smooth, wide beach, chalk-white
from minute shells, the softly surging sea
shaded into all colors of blue by shallow bars
and outlying keys, the distant ridge of green
through which, here and there, palms rose and
spread their umbrella-like foliage, all told him
that he was at last in the tropics. But where?</p>

<p>When he could, he made his way to the
water’s edge. A star-fish lay at his feet. He
grasped it as another boy might have caught
up a nugget of gold. Then another object
rolled in on the swell. At the first sight of it,
the boy smiled. Then the smile disappeared,
and he sprang forward and secured the floating
object. It was an opened tin that had contained
English orange marmalade.</p>

<p>“From some passing steamer,” thought
Andy. Then he saw that the label on the can
was not yet loosened by the water. “It hasn’t
been floatin’ long, though,” he added. “Looks
as if some Englishman isn’t far away.”</p>

<p>Ahead of him the beach curved into what
seemed to be a bay. The <i>Pelican</i> was high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
above the water, and there was no living thing
in sight that might molest it. Glad of an opportunity
to get some exercise, Andy began
trotting along the beach. Far to the south,
beyond a belt of reefs and smaller keys, he
could just make out other lines of white,—other
islands, no doubt, but nowhere was there
a sail in sight.</p>

<p>“But I guess there’s someone nearby, and
an Englishman at that,” speculated Andy.
“Since he isn’t in sight, he must be in the
cove behind the point.”</p>

<p>When the boy reached the turn in the shore,
he was astounded to see just the opposite of
the solitude in which he had alighted. At the
bottom of the bay, where a group of cocoa
palms hung almost over the water, the sight
of a thatched hut met his eye. In front of it,
and anchored several hundred yards out in
the cove, was a trim schooner, her sails furled
and a white awning covering her deck. Here
and there over the wide bay were small boats,
in each of which he could see two and sometimes
three black men, naked to the waist.</p>

<p>“They’re divin’ for sponges or tongin’
’em,” said Andy to himself as the old geography
pictures came into his mind. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
he could feast his eyes further with the picture-like
scene, he was startled to hear a voice.
At the same moment a white man, in white
duck and a Panama hat, stepped from the
shade of the palms lining the beach.</p>

<p>“How’d do?” exclaimed the man in a decided
English accent. “Did you just alight in
an aeroplane?”</p>

<p>“You saw me?” exclaimed Andy.</p>

<p>“I was on my schooner and watched you for
a long time with the glass. Come across from
Florida?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the boy. “What place is
this?”</p>

<p>“One of the Grande Banks,” replied the
stranger, “generally speaking. To be precise,
you have your choice of several local names.
Mine, for this, is Palm Tree Cove, I believe.”</p>

<p>“My name is Leighton—Andrew Leighton.
I thought I’d try it to see if I could. Now,
I’ve got to get word to my folks that I’m all
right, and get back.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Englishman had shaken
Andy’s hand.</p>

<p>“That’s not so easy,” he answered, laughing.
“The place is uninhabited; it’s off the
steamer route. I don’t belong here; we’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
prospecting the pearl and sponge bottoms.
I’m from Andros. We’ll be leaving in a day
or so. You can go with us. I’ll send you to
Nassau, or send word for you—you can cable.”</p>

<p>“You live on Andros Island?”</p>

<p>“I have fruit lands there and sisal.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’m obliged,” began Andy.
“It’s good of you. I haven’t any money.”</p>

<p>The man laughed.</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to have you as my
guest,” he said, still smiling. “And if you
are in a hurry, I’ll take you over to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’m not in a hurry to leave this,” began
Andy, sweeping his arm about to include the
cameo-like bay. “But you can understand:
I hadn’t permission to come, and, if I had, I
suppose my parents would be worrying until
they heard from me.”</p>

<p>“Not unlikely,” said the man in white. “I
think you ought to go at once, or send word.
Any little excitement of this kind is enjoyable.
If you don’t mind, I’d like to have a look at
your flying machine—I’ve never seen one, as
you can imagine. I rarely go even to Nassau—lived
on Andros twenty years.”</p>

<p>Glad to act as showman, Andy led his new
friend back along the beach to the <i>Pelican</i>. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the short trip he related how he came to be in
possession of the aeroplane, how it was made,
and finally he told of his parents, his late
uncle, and of Captain Anderson. Reaching
the car he explained it in detail, and then while
the Englishman stood back as if to feast his
eyes on the wonder, Andy said:</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind, I’ll have a bite of lunch
and a drink.”</p>

<p>As if embarrassed, the stranger raised his
hand.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, my boy—I might have known.
Can’t you postpone your refreshment until we
can reach my schooner?”</p>

<p>Andy thought a moment.</p>

<p>“I don’t like to leave the machine here—I
think I’ll make a little flight and take it around
in the cove.”</p>

<p>“Excellent,” agreed the man. “I’ll be
proud,” he went on, with a smile and bowing,
“to be host to both the aeroplane and the
aviator. And I’ll watch—”</p>

<p>A mischievous look came into Andy’s eyes.
Some distance ahead of him the hard beach
reached back over a gentle incline that made
its way like a wide road between the fence-like
cocoas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll have to get the car up there,” he said,
“to get up momentum. Do you mind giving
me a hand?”</p>

<p>“Delighted, I’m sure,” answered the fruit
grower. “It will probably be my first and last
experience with such a vehicle.”</p>

<p>Andy’s twinkle spread into a smile. When
the <i>Pelican</i> had been pushed to the top of the
slope and was ready for a new flight, he
crawled to his seat. The white-costumed man
was backing away, watching every detail. As
soon as he was seated, Andy loosened the cords
holding the tin of gasoline on the extra seat
and asked his affable host if he would put it
aside where he might get it later.</p>

<p>“I’d think you’d carry it with you,” suggested
the stranger, as he obligingly complied.</p>

<p>“I would,” answered Andy, “but I want the
seat. <a href="#i_p183">Jump in.</a>”</p>

<p>“Me?” exclaimed the man. “On that?”</p>

<p>“I just crossed the gulf stream, a thousand
feet up,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t know it would carry two,” began
the man, who seemed more surprised than
alarmed.</p>

<p>“It has,” answered the boy. “Come on.”</p>

<p>The surprise of the man turned instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
into open delight. He crawled into the seat,
and almost before he was settled, the proud
and now confident Andy had shot his pride and
joy seaward, skimmed one low roller, and was
mounting skyward as if the machine were
elated over its extra burden.</p>

<p>It was not over a mile to the head of the
cove and the cabin beneath the palms, but the
conditions made a direct flight thither impossible.
Assured of his ability to control the
powerful machine, Andy sent her mounting up
and up in a long spiral.</p>

<p>“Delightful!” said the man at his side at
last. “I’m charmed.”</p>

<p>To the boy’s surprise, there was no trace
of nervousness nor fear in his passenger’s
voice.</p>

<p>“I think we’re nearly one thousand two
hundred feet high now,” said Andy.</p>

<p>“I think so, or more,” was the passenger’s
answer. “Can you look about? The view is
superb.” The aeroplane, which had risen in
circles above the cove, now commanded a wide
view of white-margined islands, reefs, and
channels. “Far over there to the left,” went
on the Englishman, “although you can scarcely
see it, is a bit of rock with a strange history.
It is known as Timbado Key.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184-<br />185]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a slight lurch of the car, and the
passenger started.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong?” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Andy. “I was trying
to look. But this Timbado?”</p>

<p>“It’s a story,” answered his companion—“one
that has never been written. I’ll tell it
you this evening.”</p>

<p>Instantly, and for the first time since he had
landed, the tragic tale of Ba, the colored man,
rushed into Andy’s thoughts. Startled by his
unexpected proximity to the scene of Ba’s horrible
experience, his hand had moved and the
machine had wavered. Then, as the fragmentary
story came back to him, he recalled
this important detail of it—the man who had
sent the simple, half savage Ba to steal the
great pink pearl was “an English captain who
lived on Andros Island.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered the boy at last.
“I’ll be glad to hear it, Mr.—”</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said the man instantly;
“didn’t I mention my name? I am Captain
Monckton Bassett.”</p>

<small>THE CANNIBAL KING AND THE PINK PEARL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The swift tropic night had fallen, and the
black sky was aglow with winking stars—miniature
moons that turned key, reef, and water
into a phosphorescent glow. Out of the silence
came only the weird songs of the black boatmen
gathered about the camp fire at the hut
under the palms. On the schooner the evening
meal was over, and Andy sat almost lost in
dreams, while his host drew on his after-dinner
cigar.</p>

<p>When Andy and Captain Bassett had
landed, after their aerial flight into the cove,
it was nearly dusk. The boy suggested that he
would at once dismantle his machine and take
it aboard the schooner, to be carried to his
host’s home on Andros Island, and thence to
Nassau and the steamer. After his nerve-wrecking
flight in the afternoon, he did not
feel equal to another sky voyage of perhaps
one hundred and fifty miles.</p>

<p>At this, the Englishman made a peculiar
request.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t take it apart for a
little while.”</p>

<p>“Then it isn’t convenient to sail to-night?”
said Andy. “But, just as you like.”</p>

<p>It had been agreed that the schooner was to
set sail for distant Andros as soon as the moon
rose.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the man slowly. “But
I’ve been thinking of something. I can’t quite
make up my mind—I’d like to talk to you
about it after a bit. Then we’ll go as we’ve
arranged, if you like.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t that,” exclaimed the boy.
“Nothing would please me more than to stay
here always. But you can see how it is—they’ll
all be worried. I’ve got to get to the
telegraph as soon as possible and wire them
I’m not lost in the sea.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” answered Captain Bassett.
“It was thoughtless of me to ask it. Go ahead.
We’ll leave with the moon.”</p>

<p>But instead of going ahead, the boy walked
to his new-found friend’s side.</p>

<p>“What was it?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p>“A crazy idea,” answered his host, with a
laugh. “Please forget it.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” said the boy decisively. “If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
have the slightest reason to have me stay here
awhile, I know it isn’t a crazy idea. Anyway,
I won’t consent to taking you away from your
business on an hour’s notice and unless it is
convenient for you to go.”</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Coming or going is nothing to me,” he replied.
“I am here not because I am needed—my
black overseer can be trusted with my business.
But there are strange things in these
faraway keys. For a time you and your flying
machine set me thinking. I’ve dismissed the
idea—”</p>

<p>“I haven’t,” interrupted Andy. “Whatever
it was, if the <i>Pelican</i> was a part of it,
she’s goin’ to stand there until you tell me
what you had in mind.”</p>

<p>The white-costumed man looked at the boy
with a quizzical smile, appeared to be about to
speak, and then only shook his head. He and
the boy were yet standing by the ghostly
planes of the aeroplane, on which the Englishman’s
hand rested as if the machine meant
much to him.</p>

<p>“It’s about Timbado Key, isn’t it?” suggested
Andy, at last.</p>

<p>“Yes,” retorted Captain Bassett, startled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
“But how—Oh, yes, I remember: I told you
it had a tragic story. You’re a good guesser,”
he concluded, smiling again.</p>

<p>“I’m not guessing now,” went on the boy
impulsively, and unable longer to restrain himself.
“I know about Timbado and about
Cajou.”</p>

<p>The man came toward him, a look of surprise
on his face.</p>

<p>“I’ve never met any white person who
knew that,” he said at once. “What is it you
know?”</p>

<p>The remark had escaped Andy unwittingly.
He was embarrassed.</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t mean to speak yet,” he began.</p>

<p>“Why not?” retorted his companion. “What
do you know?”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry I said that, Captain
Bassett,” went on the boy slowly. “But I’ll
tell you after you tell me the real story.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t yours a real story?” laughed the
Englishman.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it isn’t,” answered Andy impulsively.
“At least, I don’t want to talk of it
now.”</p>

<p>“It must be uncomplimentary to someone,”
suggested his friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy, still much confused, blurted out:</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“Am I concerned?” asked Captain Bassett.</p>

<p>Andy looked at the man again. There was
anything but a bad look in the Englishman’s
face. His strong, sunburned countenance was
set in feature, but the boy saw nothing more
than the face of a man accustomed to giving
orders and being obeyed. Yet, being in for it,
the lad could not lie. Caught in his indiscretion,
he only nodded his head.</p>

<p>“After supper, then, we’ll talk it over,”
was the Englishman’s only comment.</p>

<p>“And,” added Andy, eager to show some
appreciation of the man’s kindness to him,
“we won’t take the machine apart until I know
what you were figuring on.”</p>

<p>“As you like,” replied the man in quite another
tone.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said until Captain Bassett’s
after-dinner cigar was going well.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “before I tell you of what
I was thinking and of Timbado Key, I’d like
to hear what you know about the place—that is,
if you like.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it at all,” answered Andy in renewed
confusion. “And I’m sure part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
what I’ve been told is not true. But I’ll finish
what I started, even if you think the less of me
for it. I ain’t much for carryin’ tales.”</p>

<p>“It may be true,” was the Englishman’s
comment, as he settled down in his canvas
deck chair and luxuriously drew on his Havana
cigar.</p>

<p>With no further preface, Andy repeated the
disjointed tale Ba, the colored man, had gradually
revealed: how the Herculean negro had
escaped from the jail in Nassau, how he had
been carried away to Nassau practically a prisoner
by Captain Bassett, how he and Nickolas
and Thomas had been sent to steal the great
pink pearl from King Cajou, how Ba had actually
seen the jewel and was lashed so cruelly,
and the unsolved mystery of what came after in
Ba’s escape and the disappearance of the other
conspirators.</p>

<p>When he had finished, there was no immediate
response from the man who presumably had
sent two men to their death at the hands of an
African cannibal—no denial. But Captain Bassett’s
cigar had gone out. The Englishman at
last drew a match on the arm of his chair. As
it flared up at the end of his cigar, the observant
boy thought he could make out a smile on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
strong face of the accused man. Then it was
dark and silent again.</p>

<p>“This nigger, Cajou,” came at last through
the half dark night from Captain Bassett’s
chair—and in a voice devoid of either guilt or
innocence—“is more than you have been told.
So far as I know, I am the only white man who
has visited his island and come away again. He
is a king, in a way. He is also the best type of
the pure blood African as he exists in our island
world. How he came to be on Timbado, no one
knows. Nor how he made about himself a settlement
of others of his kind. You can find bits
of old savagery in similar people on some of
the other ‘out islands.’ But on Timbado, in
Cajou’s realm (if you can call it that), there
no doubt exist practices that you can find nowhere
else but on the Congo.”</p>

<p>“Cannibals?” interrupted Andy, drawing
his chair forward.</p>

<p>“Among other things,” replied the speaker,
“but, of course, only by report. We can imagine
the rest. Also, by report, they are wreckers
and pirates in a small way. By my own experience,
I know they are thieves—Cajou an artful
one.”</p>

<p>“Six years ago,” went on Captain Bassett,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
“in an expedition such as I have made here, I
visited the southern reefs of the Smaller Bank,
north of Cajou’s island. As I told you, I am a
fruit and sisal hemp grower on Andros. But,
like everyone in the Bahamas, in the off season,
I utilize my men sponging. And, as you will
soon learn, sponging means possible pearls.
Like the gold prospector in other lands, we Bahamans
love to seek the unknown waters where
always there is the possibility that we never
quite realize—the Koh-i-noor of pearls; the
perfect pink pearl that is to make us fortune
and fame.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” assented the boy.</p>

<p>“As you can see,” continued the Englishman,
“it isn’t an unideal fancy. Even here, in this
beautiful cove, there is such a chance—” and
the boy could almost see a smile. “But six
years ago, idling as now in about the same kind
of a sleepy place, I got my first sight of Cajou.
In a leaky old ‘sponger,’ crowded with a cargo
of half-naked subjects, he did us the honor of
calling on us.”</p>

<p>“What’d he look like?” broke in the entranced
lad.</p>

<p>“Anything but a king,” went on the Englishman.
“He was certainly eighty years old, gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
haired and thin, but not bent. He was stripped
to the waist, his skin was oiled, and around his
bony neck was a necklace of bits of pink conch
shell. He also carried a spear that must have
come from Africa.”</p>

<p>The boy’s heart beat with excitement—this
man and his subjects were only a few miles
away.</p>

<p>“He didn’t favor me with a personal call,”
continued Captain Bassett, “but I didn’t stand
on ceremony. From what I had heard of the old
man, he had a wonderful influence on hard
working, honest colored men, and I didn’t care
to have him hanging around the bay. He arrived
about sundown, and when I rowed up to
the side of his boat, I decided not to go aboard.
The fish-cleaning shed at the market in Nassau
was perfume compared to the hold of Cajou’s
old hulk.</p>

<p>“By right, I had no control over the vicinity,
but I had plenty of help with me, and I stayed
only long enough to tell the king that I’d kick
a hole into the bottom of his boat if he wasn’t
gone by morning. He left all right, sometime
in the night, one of my crews of three blacks
with him. As that was their own business, I
had to stand it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy sighed. He had expected a dramatic
clash.</p>

<p>“That was only the prelude,” went on the
Englishman. “Three weeks later, when I had
reached home again, my pearl bag not much
heavier than when I set out, I learned something
more. I had been near fortune and just
missed it. Two days before Cajou visited our
mooring, one of my crews had made the find I
had been awaiting for years. The great pink
pearl had been found, and the usual thing happened.
My men turned conspirators and
thieves and concealed it.”</p>

<p>Andy sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>“And that’s how Cajou got it?”</p>

<p>“Precisely. One of the men confessed. The
savage but clever Cajou probably got his
charms working—like as not did it in all pearl
fleets he could find. Anyway, he got three of
my men, and you can be sure he got the pearl.”</p>

<p>“What’d you do?” asked the boy eagerly.</p>

<p>“What could I do? Somehow it became
known at once that I knew the facts. All the
men who had been with me decamped overnight.
It was useless to go to Nassau and the
authorities. I had no proof and, besides, Timbado
is far away. Later I did tell the facts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
the governor. He was good enough to tell me
if I would locate the property and establish
proof of ownership, he would attempt to recover
it. He even looked up the location of
Timbado on the official chart and asked me to
tea. I was grateful and thanked him.”</p>

<p>“Then you never even saw the pearl,” said
Andy.</p>

<p>“But I tried to,” said the captain, shaking
his head in the negative. “I judged it was
worth while. So I took the trouble to sail all
the way to Timbado and call on the king. I
took six men with me—all colored, but not
thieves—and we landed at daybreak. The place
is worth going to see,” explained the speaker.
“It isn’t much of an island. Including a coral
reef that surrounds the key, it is about a mile
across and almost circular. There is a circular
beach of sand, but the main part of the island
is a coral elevation with bluff-like sides—it resembles
the hill on which Nassau is built.</p>

<p>“My men had no longing to go ashore, so I
didn’t insist. There was no delegation to welcome
us, but I beached the boat and walked over
to a group of thatched huts at the base of the
bluff. Several men, clad mainly in rough palmetto
hats, watched my approach. One of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
fully clothed and weighing at least two hundred
pounds, came forward. He spoke English, and
was probably the secretary-of-war, as he carried
a revolver in a belt.”</p>

<p>Andy edged forward again.</p>

<p>“I told him I wanted to see the king, and he
replied by asking if I had tobacco or rum.
When I told him I wasn’t a trader and repeated
that I wanted to talk to Cajou, he pointed at
once to my boat and touched his revolver. He
was so unsociable that I took the trouble to look
over my own, and then I passed on.</p>

<p>“The collection of huts was a combination
cook camp and slaughter pen. Decaying
conchs was the predominating odor. But it was
varied with the smell of rotten shark meat, a
half-consumed shark hanging from a post in
the center of a filthy court. One glance told me
that Cajou’s house was not here, for behind the
odorous pens and the reeking cook pots, I had
seen steps cut in the coral limestone bluff.</p>

<p>“These steps,” went on Captain Bassett,
after he had supplemented his expired cigar
with a pipe, “were partly concealed under vines
and dwarfed palms. After most of those about
the beach huts had disappeared toward the top
of the elevation, I followed. When I saw this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
it occurred to me at once that the summit would
make a good cricket ground. Mainly, the place
was solid, smooth limestone with some sand and
sparse vegetation, and all sloping to the center,
where there was a considerable pool or pond.”</p>

<p>“Weren’t you afraid?” broke in his auditor.
But to this there was no reply.</p>

<p>“On the edge of the pool was a stockade, and
in this a quadrangle of latania-roofed huts.
On each side of an opening facing the water
were two dead cocoa palms. From the top of
each hung a mess of odds and ends: bones,
shark heads, colored cloth, shells on long
strings, that I knew meant royalty. I saw at
once that the palace was at the lowest part of
the basin—you couldn’t even see the tops of
the dead palms from the sea.</p>

<p>“When I started down the slope, black men
seemed to spring up from every few yards of
the little palms that grew on the edge of the
elevation. I counted thirty of them and
stopped. The fat secretary-of-war was following
me. As I got nearer, I saw something in
the things hanging from the totem-like trunks
that set me to thinking—”</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked the boy, breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the Englishman, “you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
heard the worst about Timbado. I guess it’s
true.”</p>

<p>The boy drew back in horror.</p>

<p>“And you kept on?” he asked, breathing
hard.</p>

<p>“There were a good many more than I
thought there’d be,” went on Captain Bassett,
“but I’d served in the English army, part
of the time in Afghanistan, and I thought I
might as well. When I got to the open gate,
I saw that the stockade surrounded the real
town. It seemed the dormitory for women and
children. I thought for a minute I’d seen
enough and that my men might be getting
anxious,” went on the old soldier, sucking at
his pipe, “but I didn’t have much choice. The
thirty or more full-grown men I had counted
came crowding up behind, so I went in.</p>

<p>“All this time there wasn’t a word said.
Before I could make any explanation, the king
appeared—old Cajou walked out of one of the
huts, as thin and straight and gray as I first
saw him. He had on a blue coat with brass buttons,
a navigating officer’s cap marked ‘First
Mate’ in gold letters, and he carried a gold-headed
cane. His pink shell necklace was there,
too, hanging on his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“The old man held out his hand, but my eyesight
was poor.</p>

<p>“‘Good morning,’ I began. ‘I’ve come for
my pink pearl.’</p>

<p>“I had a notion that he understood, but he
shook his head.</p>

<p>“‘You don’t speak English,’ I went on.</p>

<p>“Again he shook his head. Then I began to
have a little reason. My curiosity was satisfied.
Manifestly, I had gone the limit. Numbers,
at least, were against me, whether they
were armed or not. Before anything could be
attempted I whirled about, swung my arm to
open a path, and, as the crowd behind me fell
back, I walked out of the enclosure. A hubbub
of voices rose behind me, but not a hand was
raised against me. Indifference seemed the
best weapon, and I strolled up to the edge of the
plateau, passed down the steps and to the
boat.”</p>

<p>“Then what?” urged the boy.</p>

<p>“I had got about as much as I expected. But
I did not give up wholly. I sailed back home,
and at last decided on one more attempt. It
was a slim chance, but I took it. I have often
regretted it. Your Ba was working for me then—his
name then was Zaco. I coached Zaco and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
two other men named Nickolas and Thomas
to go to Timbado and pose as castaways—not
as thieves. They were simply to discover, if
possible, whether the pearl was still there or
had been disposed of.</p>

<p>“Not one of them ever returned. Your story
is the first account I ever had of their fate.
Nickolas and Thomas are either there to-day
as Cajou’s subjects, or they are dead. Zaco,
of course, escaped—somehow. The marks he
carries with him prove that he saw the pearl
and that it was there at that time. I’ve felt
that it has been there all these years. Now that
we know it—” and he paused.</p>

<p>“What?” exclaimed his listener, every nerve
atingle.</p>

<p>“Let’s go and get it—you and I and the aeroplane,”
continued Captain Bassett calmly.</p>

<small>THE BIRD OF DEATH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Captain Bassett’s yacht-like schooner did not
sail that night. Long after the camp fire of the
spongers on the beach had fallen into a glow,
the Englishman and Andy were in talk in the
owner’s cabin. On the chart before them the
compasses were often in play between a dot
marked “Timbado Key” and the unnamed indentation
in a long island, where the boy had
written in pencil “Palm Tree Cove.”</p>

<p>At seven o’clock the next morning, two of the
black men had brought up the unloaded can of
gasoline. Andy had been taken ashore to the
<i>Pelican</i>, two of the more intelligent spongers
had been detailed to assist him, and the
schooner was heading out of the cove, its owner
on the after deck waving his Panama to the boy
on shore.</p>

<p>A box of cloth, screws, wire, a hammer and
saw, candles, tin pans, and three bamboo fishing
poles had been sent ashore with the young aviator.
Before the schooner had rounded the
point and laid a course to the west, the operator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
of the aeroplane was busy. His shirt
sleeves rolled up, barefooted and hatless, the
boy did not seem to mind the semi-tropic sun.
After a solitary luncheon he was at his task
again. At three o’clock he paused—the <i>Pelican</i>
a weird and picturesque sight, her tanks newly
filled, her oil cups freshly primed. Whatever
her new mission, she was undoubtedly ready
for another flight.</p>

<p>Andy’s fishermen assistants viewed the altered
machine with silent awe. When they had
helped to wheel it into an advantageous location
for a new start and had been dismissed,
they hurried away, and the boy was alone.
From his actions, the hours were dragging.
Four and five o’clock passed with no signs of
a new flight. The impatient Andy made constant
references to the sun and his watch, with
now and then little alterations in the aeroplane’s
new equipment.</p>

<p>Frequently the boy also consulted a slip of
paper.</p>

<p>“North, northwest,” he would repeat, “and
twenty-five miles. At a minute and a half a
mile, that’s thirty-seven and one-half minutes.”</p>

<p>Thirty-eight minutes before Captain Bassett’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
calculation of sundown, at 6:35 P.M., the
eager boy at last sprang into his seat, set his
brake, turned on his power, and in thirty seconds
the low-hanging palm leaves behind him,
fluttering before his propellers, the now picturesque
<i>Pelican</i> was skimming over the wide
reach of Palm Tree Cove.</p>

<p>At one o’clock that afternoon Captain Bassett’s
schooner was tacking off Timbado Key.
When it dropped anchor off the makeshift of
a beach village that its navigator had visited
six years before, a few blacks emerged from the
hovels. But no one on the schooner came
ashore, and in the boat there were no signs of
activity. The white-costumed Englishman sat
and smoked under the awning. By mid-afternoon
the beach was thick with a curious group.</p>

<p>When the sun was low in the west, a few minutes
before seven o’clock, a small boat shot
out from the idle, anchored schooner. As it
grounded on the beach, the semi-savage blacks
who had watched the strange boat all afternoon,
moved forward. Captain Bassett, in spotless
white, sprang ashore. He paused only to light
a fresh cigar, and then, ignoring the motley
straggling group, he walked quickly to the steps
leading to the plateau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, with only a glance over the sloping
sides of the basin and the stagnant pool at its
bottom—its heavy waters already iridescent in
the dying sun—he strode rapidly toward the
stockade. As he had seen it before, the king’s
home still stood—the signs of decay more evident,
but the totem palm trunks still erect.</p>

<p>No one blocked his passage, but he did not
enter the gate. Still swaying on the palm
trunks, he saw that which sent a chill through
him. He also saw, almost above, but apparently
guarding the gate, the big black who had
accosted him on the beach years before. The
man was heavier, there was a brutish kind of
fear on his face, but he yet carried in his belt
the one revolver the Englishman had seen on
the island.</p>

<p>“Tell the great thief Cajou the white man
is here.”</p>

<p>Captain Bassett uttered these words in a
tone that made the big black start.</p>

<p>“Him no walk,” was the answer in a hesitating
voice.</p>

<p>“Tell the great thief Cajou that the white
man brings death.”</p>

<p>“Him sick,” faltered the swarthy guardian.</p>

<p>Within the shadow of the filthy stockade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
court, other men could now be seen. The white
man could see the glare of eyes as if beasts
were crouching in the fast-gathering night.</p>

<p>“Tell the great thief Cajou,” went on the
white man—his tone unchanged, cold and imperative,
“that to-night comes the Bird of
Death. He who was robbed of his pearl, to-night
brings fetich; to-night, the white man
brings death to the women and children of
thieves; to-night, out of the south, he commands
the Bird of Death.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the Englishman observed almost
concealed behind those in the enclosure,
the old African. He was bent now, and as the
silent assembly fell back to give the grizzled
savage space, the white man saw that all he had
said had been heard and understood. Two
women supported the ruler of Timbado. Shaking
them aside, he felt his way to the gate on
his cane.</p>

<p>“White man come—white man go. No
come—no go more.”</p>

<p>“The great thief Cajou hears,” interrupted
the unmoving man in white. “To-night, the
white man brings fetich; to-night, out of the
sky, he brings death to those who steal and lie
and to the women and children of those who
lie—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>The tottering chief lunged forward on his
stick as if to grasp the white man. But the latter
did not move.</p>

<p>“Cajou no thief,” snarled the black. “Him
no white man pearl.”</p>

<p>Throwing his head back, the Englishman
placed his hands to his mouth and called loudly
into the now shadowed night.</p>

<p>“Come, Bird of Death,” he cried. Then,
with a sweep of his right arm toward the south,
he shouted: “Behold!”</p>

<p>Sweeping majestically toward the palm totems
out of the already starry night, came an
object with the whirr of a flock of vultures.
Like a great bird, the descending shape already
spread its monstrous wings over the black pool.
Its long tail could be seen moving against the
starry sky, while the eyes and throat of its far-extended
head seemed to belch fire and smoke.</p>

<p>Back upon each other crowded those about
Cajou. Alone stood the old man, shaking and
aghast. Then out of the mouth of the giant
bird came a cry of rage and the hiss of a snake.
Wails and cries of fear rent the air; groveling
on their knees, the occupants of the stockade
tried to hide their heads; even the great black
threw himself behind the wall. Then the angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
blood-red eyes of the Bird of Death struck
toward the group, and even the doughty Cajou
reeled backward.</p>

<p>“Stop!” shouted the white man. “Stop,
Bird of Death! Go!” he cried.</p>

<p>As if balked of its prey, the great creature
of the air seemed to pause. Then, with an almost
human snarl, it shot to the left, circled
over the pool and began to mount the skies in
apparent flight.</p>

<p>For a moment the sobs and cries of the prostrate
were all that could be heard. The ruler
of the tropic key still stood, but shaking in
terror.</p>

<p>“White man go,” he mumbled at last. But
his defiance was gone. “Cajou no got white
man’s pearl.”</p>

<p>“You lie!” exclaimed the Englishman. Then
he held out his hand. “Give!” he commanded.
His tone seemed to wound the black man.
“No?” he added fiercely, as Cajou only
cringed.</p>

<p>“Cajou no pearl, no thief,” at last began the
African.</p>

<p>“Come, Bird of Death,” cried the white man
once more. “Eat the women and children of
the great thief. Come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210-<br />211]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke, he could see the blood-red eyes
turned toward him again; then he saw the
points of fire dip, and he knew the indistinguishable
object was once more hurtling toward the
stockade.</p>

<p>There were new cries of terror. Then the
hiss and snarl high above sounded again. Bigger
grew the glaring eyes of the Bird of Death,
and then out of its gaping throat came a stream
of fire. The roar of the returning object swept
before it.</p>

<p>“Eat black man; eat black man!” came a
voice out of the hollow sky.</p>

<p>Amid a hundred shrieks, a terror-stricken
form threw itself at the white man’s feet.</p>

<p>“Cajou lie; Cajou lie,” it wailed. “White
man make stop.”</p>

<p><a href="#i_p209">“Come, Bird of Death!”</a> roared the iron-nerved
Englishman.</p>

<p>“Eat black woman, eat black baby!” fell
again from the clouds.</p>

<p>One more look, and the prostrate Cajou
caught at the buttons on his faded coat, tore
the garment loose at the neck, and struck out
his palsied hand.</p>

<p>“Stop!” commanded the man in white, as he
shot up his arm to stay the avenging bird. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
could barely see the old man; but he felt the
outstretched hand. Grasping the object in it,
he found it still attached to a cord. With a
snap he tore it loose. His fingers closed on
what he knew was a small skin bag. Then with
a thrill he felt within the bag a pear-shaped
object. It required no look to tell him what it
was.</p>

<p>“Begone!” he cried. “Cajou saves his
people.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he discharged his revolver over
the heads of the prostrate subjects of the outwitted
black man, and there was an answering
shout from the fiery Bird of Death as it swept
over the stockade. The Fiend of the Skies had
been thwarted once more by the fetich of the
white man and, with another hiss of rage, its
yawning throat yet spitting flames and smoke,
the Bird of Death turned and disappeared
seaward.</p>

<p>When it had passed, and Cajou and his
people looked again for the all-powerful white
man who had saved them, he was gone. None
followed the retreating ghostlike form of the
fetich maker, and as Captain Bassett felt his
way down the bluff steps, he could see fading
the red eyes of the air monster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>On the beach once more, his faithful men and
boat ready for him, he paused, drew the little
bag from his pocket and struck a match. There
was but one glance, and he threw the match
from him. Cajou had not deceived him this
time. The great pink pearl had come back to
its owner.</p>

<p>When the <i>Pelican</i> sailed away from Palm
Tree Cove on that eventful evening, thirty-seven
and one-half minutes before sunset, the
spongers, left in open-mouthed wonder, soon
began an important task. Dry driftwood and
fallen palm trees were collected until it was
wholly dark. Then fires were started on the
beach in two places, to the right and left of the
<i>Pelican’s</i> starting place. A few minutes after
eight o’clock, out of a louder and louder whirr
in the starlit skies, with a rush as of a rising
wind, the aeroplane darted beachward.</p>

<p>In the shadows, the daring young aviator,
stiff in muscle and worn with strain, landed in
the shallow water. As if newly alarmed, the
waiting spongers hung back. But the tired boy
sprang into the water, grasped the sinking machine,
and in a few moments a dozen willing
hands had drawn it high on the white sand.
With no attempt to dry his clothes, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
only a glance at his watch in the glare of the
beach fires, the exhausted boy threw himself on
the sand alongside the aeroplane and was soon
unconscious.</p>

<p>When he awoke, it was day, and Captain Bassett
was standing over him.</p>

<p>“Come to the schooner,” said the Englishman
kindly, “get some breakfast and a bath
and finish your sleep in bed.”</p>

<p>Dazed for a moment, Andy rubbed his eyes,
and then sprang into a sitting posture.</p>

<p>“Did you get it?” he cried eagerly.</p>

<p>The captain smiled, nodded his head, and
then looked knowingly toward the spongers just
departing for their day’s work.</p>

<p>“I understand,” exclaimed the boy jubilantly.
“It was a peach of an idea. The old
<i>Pelican</i> was all right, wasn’t she?”</p>

<p>Again Captain Bassett smiled and assisted
the stiff boy to his feet.</p>

<p>“The idea was all right, but you did the business.
She don’t look so awful now, does she?”
and he pointed toward the still bedraggled aeroplane.</p>

<p>Both broke into laughter. Drooping on the
beach, lay the <i>Pelican’s</i> improvised neck and
bird head made of lashed bamboo poles. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
two suspended lanterns covered with red calico
curtains from the schooner were far from deceptive
in the sunlight. The band of red cloth
on a crude frame beneath these, behind which
had hung balls of coal oil soaked rags (the
throat of the marvelous bird) was sagging in
the sand.</p>

<p>“Here’s where I touched off the balls,” explained
Andy, still chuckling with amusement.
“My oil string fuse ran through these wire
loops.”</p>

<p>“When the wind blew the flames down,” said
the captain, “it was like a dragon spitting fire.
And that yell of yours! It wasn’t much like a
bird—it was most grewsome. Andy,” he added
suddenly and seriously, “of course, it isn’t necessary
to say you’ve done a big thing for me.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to begin that,” exclaimed
the boy at once. “You’ve helped me and are
goin’ to help me some more. That’s enough.
But I’d like to see the pearl.”</p>

<p>Cautiously the Englishman took the bag from
his pocket. As the boy’s eyes fell on the lustrous,
pale rose-colored gem, he caught his companion’s
arm. In the shape of a flattened pear
and almost an inch and a half long, the tropic
jewel seemed to radiate a glow of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s it worth?” whispered the dazed
boy.</p>

<p>“Twenty years of isolation in this desolate
world,” said the suddenly sobered Englishman.
“In money, it has no price. It is not for sale.”</p>

<p>There was no more rest for Andy that morning.
When the <i>Pelican</i> had been taken apart
and loaded on the schooner and Captain Bassett’s
crews of spongers had been embarked in
their small boats, it was noon. While luncheon
was served under the awning, the schooner
passed out of the cove on her way to Andros
Island.</p>

<p>Physically exhausted and his nerves unstrung,
Captain Bassett put Andy in his bunk
at once. When he awoke it was dark, the
schooner was cutting through a moonlit sea and
the boy knew it was late in the night. When he
awoke again it was day and the schooner was
tacking among almost countless islands.</p>

<p>A little later Andros Island was in sight.
Then a heavily-laden schooner, freighted with
baled sisal hemp and crates of oranges and pineapples,
was hailed by the incoming schooner.</p>

<p>“It’s one of my boats,” explained Captain
Bassett, “on her way to Nassau. We’ll send
your cablegram on it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not put me aboard?” asked Andy,
again lively and full of vim.</p>

<p>“It can’t well take the aeroplane,” explained
the Englishman. “Besides, I want to take you
to Nassau myself. I’ll see you properly started
for your own country.”</p>

<p>That was why the daring young adventurer
was some days in the rear of his cablegram.
When, in a few days, he did reach the interesting
historic old town of Nassau, he was forced
to accept several more favors from his kindly
host. He saw no way of escaping a loan sufficient
to cover his passage by steamer and rail
back to Valkaria by way of Lake Worth, and
to pay the freight bill on his aeroplane.</p>

<p>“But I’ll return it,” insisted Andy.</p>

<p>“As you like,” responded his friend, “if
you’ll bring it yourself, and your father, and
mother, and spend a winter with me on Andros.”</p>

<p>“And Ba?” added the boy.</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of him as long as he lives, if
he’ll come,” was the Englishman’s answer.</p>

<p>When the big Florida-bound steamer had
made her way out past Hog Island and was in
the channel roll, the boy went below to inspect
his cabin. Pinned to the pillow on his bed was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
an envelope addressed: “Mr. Andrew Leighton—to
be opened at sea.”</p>

<p>Tearing it open, a narrow strip of blue paper
dropped in Andy’s hands. It read: “Royal
Bank of Nassau. Pay to Andrew Leighton or
order £1,000. Monckton Bassett.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
